Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Former President Bill Clinton's recent remarks about the relationship between political allies and donor favors have ignited a media firestorm, drawing attention to the ongoing debate surrounding the Clinton Foundation and its critics. Clinton stated that it is ""natural"" for political allies to ask for favors, but he stressed that such requests do not guarantee that they will be fulfilled. This assertion has led to renewed discussions about the implications of donor influence in politics and the ethical boundaries that should govern such relationships.

Despite the media frenzy, Clinton defended the integrity of the Clinton Foundation, asserting that there is no evidence of a ""pay to play"" arrangement, even though some donors have had meetings with him and his associates. This statement aims to clarify the foundation's operations and to counter accusations that it operates in a manner that compromises ethical standards.

In contrast, the Trump Foundation is currently under scrutiny, with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman conducting an investigation into potential improprieties related to charity laws. Reports have surfaced indicating that former President Donald Trump has not personally donated to his own foundation since 2008. Instead, the Trump Foundation has been reported to collect and redistribute donations while operating in Trump's name, raising questions about the foundation's transparency and accountability.

Adding to the controversy, reports have emerged alleging that Trump misused charity funds for personal purchases. Notable expenditures include a $20,000 painting of himself and a $12,000 football helmet, which have raised eyebrows and prompted further inquiries into the foundation's financial practices. These allegations highlight a stark contrast between the operational practices of the Clinton Foundation and the Trump Foundation, leading to a broader conversation about the ethical responsibilities of charitable organizations.

Media coverage of these issues has sparked criticism from various quarters, particularly regarding what some view as a double standard in the treatment of Trump and Clinton. Media Matters has pointed out that there appears to be a disproportionate emphasis on minor issues concerning Clinton, while more serious concerns regarding Trump's charitable practices have been downplayed. This perceived bias in media reporting has been interpreted by some as detrimental to Clinton's campaign, potentially influencing public perception and voter sentiment.

As the 2024 election approaches, the implications of these discussions are significant. Clinton's comments may resonate with voters who are wary of the influence of money in politics, while the scrutiny of the Trump Foundation could raise questions about Trump's qualifications as a candidate. However, the media's role in shaping these narratives cannot be overlooked. The focus on Clinton's foundation, juxtaposed with the leniency afforded to Trump's alleged misdeeds, may create an uneven playing field in the eyes of the electorate.

The ongoing investigations and media coverage surrounding both foundations underscore the complexities of political fundraising and charitable contributions in the modern political landscape. For Clinton, the challenge will be to navigate the narrative surrounding the Clinton Foundation while addressing the broader concerns about donor influence in politics. For Trump, the scrutiny of his foundation may serve as a reminder of the importance of transparency and ethical conduct in charitable endeavors.

As both candidates prepare for the upcoming election, the interplay between their respective foundations and the media's portrayal of their actions will likely continue to shape the political discourse. Voters will be tasked with discerning the truth amid the noise, making informed decisions based on the information presented to them.

In conclusion, Clinton's remarks have brought to light the intricate relationship between political donations, favors, and media coverage. As investigations into the Trump Foundation unfold and the narrative surrounding the Clinton Foundation continues to evolve, the implications for both candidates could be profound. The ongoing discourse highlights the necessity for transparency and ethical standards in political fundraising, ensuring that the integrity of charitable organizations remains a priority for all stakeholders involved.",6.0,23.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,729.0,0.8846153846153846,0.03155006858710562
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A recently leaked draft congressional report has sparked controversy regarding the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and its distribution of HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa. The report, titled “The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” claims that CHAI distributed ""watered-down"" drugs that may have increased morbidity and mortality risks among patients in the region. This development could have significant implications for the Clinton Foundation, particularly as Hillary Clinton gears up for her presidential campaign.

The report was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, who has taken a keen interest in the operations of the Clinton Foundation and its various initiatives. CHAI's AIDS program has been widely recognized as one of the foundation's significant contributions to global health, aimed at increasing access to life-saving medications for those living with HIV/AIDS. However, the new allegations put a spotlight on the quality of the drugs being supplied and the potential consequences for patients relying on these medications.

A central focus of the report is the relationship between Bill Clinton and Ranbaxy, an Indian drug manufacturer that emerged as a key distributor of HIV/AIDS drugs under CHAI's program. The report references Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee and whistleblower, who played a crucial role in bringing to light the company's fraudulent practices. Thakur's revelations contributed to a U.S. government prosecution of Ranbaxy for distributing adulterated drugs. In 2013, the company pleaded guilty to seven criminal counts and was subsequently fined $500 million by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ's findings indicated that Ranbaxy's diluted drugs posed increased risks to patients, raising serious questions about the safety of the medications distributed by CHAI.

Rep. Blackburn's report has prompted her to question the extent of the harm caused by the distribution of substandard drugs. With the exact number of AIDS patients who may have received these diluted drugs remaining unclear, the implications of the report could lead to increased scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation and its operations. The report has been submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of State for further investigation.

The study delves into the ties between Bill Clinton and various controversial Indian-Americans, some of whom have faced investigations by the FDA and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ranbaxy has a documented history of poor quality control and attempted cover-ups, yet CHAI continued to promote the company as a reliable supplier of HIV/AIDS medications. This raises serious ethical questions about the oversight and accountability of the initiative.

In 2004, the FDA began issuing warnings to Ranbaxy regarding drug potency issues, just one year after CHAI began its partnership with the manufacturer. Despite these warnings and the fact that Ranbaxy's drugs are banned in the United States, CHAI has continued to distribute their HIV/AIDS medications abroad. This practice has raised eyebrows among health experts and advocates, who are concerned about the potential risks to patients who depend on these drugs for their survival.

In a striking contrast, Bill Clinton publicly praised Ranbaxy in 2013, asserting that their drugs had saved lives. This statement has now come under scrutiny in light of the allegations presented in the congressional report. The report also notes that while CHAI officially separated from the Clinton Foundation in 2010, it continues to maintain close ties with overlapping board members and staff, suggesting that the foundation's influence over CHAI's operations may still be significant.

The report further suggests that Bill Clinton may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order that pertained to intellectual property laws for HIV/AIDS medicines. This action could have had far-reaching implications for the quality of drugs being distributed under CHAI's programs. The initiative began distributing generic HIV drugs from multiple foreign manufacturers, including Ranbaxy, in 2003, which has now become a point of contention.

Adding another layer of complexity to the situation are the allegations of potential corruption within the program, as the report discusses how the initiative may have benefited the Clinton Foundation financially. Relationships with Indian-American businessmen associated with the American Indian Foundation are also scrutinized, particularly in light of Rajat Gupta's insider trading conviction, which has cast a shadow over the integrity of those connected to the foundation.

Rep. Blackburn has expressed concern about the emotional toll that the distribution of substandard drugs may have had on healthcare workers and patients. She highlighted the false hopes created by the Clinton Foundation, which could have led to devastating consequences for individuals who believed they were receiving effective treatment. The emotional impact of such disillusionment cannot be understated, especially in regions where access to healthcare is already fraught with challenges.

As the report continues to circulate and gain attention, the potential ramifications for the Clinton Foundation and its initiatives are becoming increasingly apparent. With the upcoming presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton may find herself facing tough questions about her family's philanthropic efforts and their implications for public health.

The draft report serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding global health initiatives and the ethical considerations that must be taken into account when distributing medications to vulnerable populations. As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how the Clinton Foundation will respond to these allegations and whether the public will demand greater accountability from such organizations in the future.

In conclusion, the draft congressional report raises serious questions about the practices of the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its relationship with Ranbaxy. The allegations of distributing ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs highlight the potential risks to patients and the ethical implications for the Clinton Foundation. As scrutiny increases, the foundation may need to address these concerns head-on, particularly as the political landscape shifts with the upcoming presidential campaign. The health and well-being of countless individuals depend on the integrity of such initiatives, making it imperative that transparency and accountability remain at the forefront of global health efforts.",-6.0,-2.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,1096.0,-0.05128205128205128,-0.0018248175182481751
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a shocking turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed shortly before entering her van after attending a 9-11 ceremony in New York City. This incident has reignited discussions about her health and fitness for public office, particularly as the presidential election approaches.

Following her collapse, Clinton made a surprising appearance at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment. However, observers noted that she looked significantly different from her usual self. The most striking change was her appearance; she appeared more energetic and lighter, leading to speculation about her well-being and the authenticity of her public persona. Adding to the intrigue, some pointed out that Clinton's nose appeared altered, resembling a Roman type rather than her previously recognized Nordic nose.

This alteration has led to rampant speculation about the possibility of a clone being used for her public appearances. The new version of Clinton appeared younger and devoid of visible signs of aging, notably lacking a mole that has long been a fixture above her right lip. This has raised questions about the integrity of her public image and the extent to which her health may affect her campaign.

As the political landscape shifts in anticipation of the upcoming election, concerns are mounting regarding Clinton's ability to participate in debates, particularly against her rival, Donald Trump. Observers are advised to remain vigilant and watch for changes in her appearance, voice, and behavior, as these may provide clues to determine whether they are witnessing the real Hillary Clinton or a potential clone.

The implications of a potential clone managing public engagements have led to further speculation about the nature of a Clinton Administration should she be elected. There are growing concerns that Hillary could merely serve as a figurehead, with real decision-making power resting in the hands of her cabinet while the clone handles public-facing responsibilities. This scenario raises significant questions about transparency and accountability in leadership.

The situation has drawn comparisons to previous speculation surrounding former President Barack Obama, where discussions about his leadership style and decision-making processes hinted at a lack of transparency. The notion of a non-transparent leadership model has now resurfaced, with Clinton's circumstances prompting similar conversations about the authenticity of political figures and the roles they play.

As the election season heats up, the public's perception of Hillary Clinton is likely to be influenced by these developments. The speculation surrounding her health and the potential use of a clone for public appearances may shape voter opinions and ultimately impact the election's outcome.

The views expressed in this article reflect the author's perspective and do not necessarily represent the stance of EagleRising.com. As the political landscape evolves, the public remains on alert, questioning the implications of health, identity, and authenticity in the realm of politics. The coming months will be crucial in determining how these factors play into the broader narrative of the election and the future of American leadership. 

In a time when trust in political figures is paramount, the unfolding story of Hillary Clinton's health and public appearances will undoubtedly be a focal point for both supporters and critics alike. As the election draws nearer, all eyes will be on Clinton to see how these issues are addressed and what they mean for the future of her candidacy.",8.0,9.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,615.0,0.391304347826087,0.014634146341463415
Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

In the lead-up to the upcoming election, former President Donald Trump has ignited a firestorm of debate with his controversial statements regarding immigration and the Muslim community. His rhetoric has raised alarm bells among civil rights advocates and concerned citizens, as many fear the implications of his proposed policies could lead to extreme measures reminiscent of some of history's darkest chapters.

One of Trump's most notorious proposals is the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which he claims is necessary to prevent ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers"" from entering the country. This statement has been met with significant backlash, as critics argue that it perpetuates harmful stereotypes about immigrants and fails to address the complexities of immigration reform. 

Further compounding the controversy, Trump has suggested implementing a national registry for Muslims, drawing a parallel to Nazi Germany's systematic persecution of the Jewish population. This comparison has been particularly troubling for many, who see it as an attempt to dehumanize an entire faith community. The implications of such a registry raise questions about civil liberties and the potential for discrimination against American citizens based solely on their religion.

In a strikingly aggressive stance, Trump has also proposed targeting the families of terrorists, suggesting that they should be killed as a means of deterrence. This approach has been criticized as not only morally questionable but also as a violation of fundamental human rights. Such rhetoric raises significant ethical concerns, especially in a nation that prides itself on justice and due process.

Trump's Senior Communications Advisor has articulated a broader strategy, indicating that Trump is focused on combating what they describe as the ""narratives"" propagated by President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The advisor has advocated for a ""kill them all"" approach to terrorism, which suggests a willingness to escalate military actions without regard for the consequences. This aggressive posture has sparked fears about the potential for increased violence and instability both domestically and internationally.

Critics of the Trump administration have pointed to the former president's repeated criticisms of the Obama administration for allowing immigrants from ""dangerous countries"" to gain U.S. citizenship. Trump has claimed that radical Islamic terrorism has surged under the policies of Obama and Clinton, a statement that has been met with skepticism by experts who argue that terrorism is a complex issue influenced by a multitude of factors beyond immigration policy.

In addition to his aggressive stance on immigration, Trump has expressed a profound distrust of the Muslim community. He has suggested that Muslims are not adequately reporting terrorist activities, further fueling a narrative that paints an entire community as complicit in violence. This rhetoric can exacerbate tensions and foster an environment of fear and suspicion, potentially leading to increased discrimination and violence against innocent individuals.

The implications of Trump's rhetoric are concerning, particularly regarding the possibility of mass roundups or exterminations of Muslims should he return to the presidency. Such extreme measures would not only violate the constitutional rights of American citizens but also undermine the foundational principles of equality and justice that the nation is built upon. The prospect of targeting individuals based on their faith is a chilling reminder of the past and raises questions about the future of civil liberties in America.

Moreover, the contradiction in Trump’s statements regarding constitutional rights becomes evident when considering recent attacks carried out by individuals with various backgrounds. While he has called for stringent measures against specific communities, he has often sidestepped the broader issue of homegrown terrorism and the need for comprehensive solutions that address the root causes of violence, regardless of the perpetrator's background.

As the election approaches, the article urges voters to reflect on the potential consequences of Trump's presidency. The warning is clear: the rhetoric surrounding immigration and terrorism is not merely political posturing; it has real-world implications that could affect millions of lives. The call to action is for citizens to engage in the electoral process and consider the values they want to uphold in their nation.

In conclusion, Donald Trump's controversial statements and proposed policies regarding immigrants and the Muslim community have sparked significant concern among many Americans. The potential for extreme measures, coupled with a disregard for constitutional rights, paints a troubling picture of what could lie ahead should he regain the presidency.

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, advocating for a One World Government and globalization.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Allegations of pay-to-play corruption have emerged against Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the integrity of the philanthropic organization. Critics contend that the foundation, rather than being a genuine charitable entity, primarily functions as a profit-making venture for the Clinton family and their associates.

In response to these serious allegations, the Clinton campaign has emphasized the foundation's charitable work, asserting that it has made significant contributions to various causes. However, scrutiny of the foundation's financial records reveals a troubling picture. According to IRS filings, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation’s budget in 2014 was allocated to charitable grants, a figure that has drawn criticism from watchdog groups and political opponents alike.

In 2014, the Clinton Foundation reportedly spent approximately $91.3 million. Of this amount, less than $5.2 million was directed toward charitable grants, raising concerns about the organization’s priorities. A significant portion of the foundation's expenditures, $34.8 million, was dedicated to salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, while another $50.4 million was categorized as ""other expenses."" This allocation of funds has led many to question whether the foundation is fulfilling its intended mission of philanthropy or primarily serving the financial interests of its founders.

Moreover, the foundation's charitable spending saw a notable decrease of 40% in 2014 compared to the previous year, despite an increase of $30 million in revenue. This decline in charitable contributions, alongside a $5 million rise in spending on salaries and other expenses, has intensified calls for transparency and accountability from the organization.

The overarching concern is that the Clintons may have leveraged Hillary Clinton's position as Secretary of State to secure financial contributions to the foundation in exchange for political favors. This perceived exchange of influence has led to widespread skepticism regarding the foundation's operations and has raised ethical questions about the conduct of both Hillary and Bill Clinton.

As the allegations continue to circulate, the foundation's defenders argue that its work has had a positive impact globally. However, the financial data and the allegations of corruption have cast a shadow over the foundation's reputation, prompting ongoing discussions about the intersection of politics and philanthropy.

Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

During that event, Clinton experienced convulsions and was lifted into her van, prompting immediate concern among attendees.

Initially, her campaign attributed the episode to the heat, but it was later disclosed that the temperature in New York City was a mild 74 degrees. Following the incident, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea's apartment, passing multiple hospitals on the way, which raised eyebrows and fueled speculation regarding her health.

The rally in Greensboro has since been the subject of scrutiny, with questions surrounding its authenticity. Some observers speculated that the event might have been staged to demonstrate Clinton's recovery. A video from the rally sparked further suspicion, as it appeared that cameras in the audience were not focused on Clinton herself.

In response to these concerns, additional videos emerged analyzing the audience's behavior, suggesting that the crowd may have been artificially created. However, a C-Span video was referenced to confirm that the footage of the rally was not doctored, attempting to quell the swirling rumors about the event's legitimacy. As Clinton continues her campaign, the scrutiny surrounding her health and public appearances remains a focal point of discussion.",4.0,2.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,253.0,0.2,0.007905138339920948
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

In a striking blend of humor and concern, the author of ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" expresses palpable excitement for the fictional movie while simultaneously critiquing the media's coverage of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The film, which plays on the themes of unexpected events and strange circumstances, serves as a fitting metaphor for the current state of Clinton's political journey, particularly in light of her ongoing health issues that have become a focal point of public discourse.

Despite the lighthearted tone of the movie's title, the author takes a serious stance on how media outlets have handled discussions regarding Clinton's health. They argue that many in the press treat her medical challenges as mere minor setbacks, failing to address the growing public skepticism surrounding her well-being. This skepticism is not unfounded, as Clinton has faced a series of health-related incidents that have raised eyebrows and led to questions about her fitness for office.

The author paints a picture of Clinton as a severely ill individual, suggesting that her explanations regarding her health are inadequate and do little to alleviate public concern. This portrayal is underscored by the presence of a ""mystery man"" who is often seen accompanying Clinton during medical emergencies. The author speculates that this individual carries a Diazepam pen, a medication commonly used to treat seizures, hinting at a deeper, more troubling aspect of her health that remains unaddressed in public forums.

Adding to the intrigue, the author notes Clinton's choice to wear blue-tinted glasses, which are often associated with seizure patients and those suffering from Parkinson's disease. This detail further fuels speculation about her health and raises questions about the transparency of her campaign. Critics argue that the Clinton campaign has not been forthcoming about her medical history, particularly concerning past incidents that may have impacted her ability to serve effectively as president.

The lack of transparency regarding Clinton's health issues is a significant point of contention. The author asserts that her perceived dishonesty about her condition only serves to reinforce public mistrust regarding her fitness for the presidency. As voters become increasingly aware of her health struggles, they may question whether she is capable of handling the demands of the highest office in the land.

The political ramifications of Clinton's health issues are already evident in her declining poll numbers. The author links this downward trend to her recent health crisis and her controversial statements regarding Trump supporters. Such remarks have not only alienated potential voters but have also contributed to a broader narrative that questions her ability to connect with the American public.

Moreover, the author highlights what they perceive as hypocrisy in Clinton's remarks about racism and social justice. They reference her past associations and the historical context of her party, suggesting that her current stance may lack authenticity. This perceived inconsistency adds another layer of complexity to her public persona and raises further doubts about her leadership.

Despite the criticisms, the author expresses a mix of compassion and critique for Clinton. They acknowledge her long-standing political ambitions and the challenges she has faced throughout her career. However, this compassion does not overshadow the author's desire for accountability and transparency in her campaign.

As the narrative unfolds, the author concludes with a hope that recent events signal the decline of Clinton's political career. While they wish her a healthy life outside of politics, there is an underlying sentiment that the time has come for a new generation of leaders to emerge. The juxtaposition of concern for Clinton's health and the desire for change in political leadership encapsulates the complex feelings many Americans have towards her candidacy.

In the end, ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" serves as more than just a fictional movie title; it encapsulates the uncertainty and drama surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and political future. As the public grapples with the implications of her health on her candidacy, the author invites readers to reflect on the broader questions of transparency, trust, and the evolving landscape of American politics.",-18.0,-2.0,1165.0,-0.375,-0.015450643776824034,758.0,-0.07142857142857142,-0.002638522427440633

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a pivotal address at the United Nations Assembly, former President Barack Obama articulated his concerns regarding the ongoing battle against ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups. With a tone of urgency and realism, Obama expressed doubts about the effectiveness of military power in defeating these entities, which he controversially referred to as a ""JV team,"" highlighting the complexities and limitations of traditional military strategies.

Obama underscored the significant challenges faced by the United States, often viewed as a global police force, in this multifaceted struggle. He pointed out the alarming growth of the Islamic State and the escalating number of militants as critical factors contributing to the inadequacy of military solutions. His remarks resonated with the understanding that a purely militaristic approach may not suffice in addressing the root causes of extremism.

In his address, Obama emphasized the necessity for honesty regarding the nature of contemporary conflicts, advocating for a shift toward diplomacy rather than reliance on military action. He argued that the international community must confront these challenges with a clear-eyed perspective, acknowledging the complexities of the situations at hand. The former president suggested that efforts should be directed toward delivering humanitarian aid, supporting political settlements, and fostering coexistence among diverse communities to mitigate the conditions that fuel extremism.

A significant portion of Obama's address was dedicated to criticizing the reluctance among some leaders to recognize the connection between radical Islam and violence. He warned that ignoring this link could exacerbate the situation, allowing extremist ideologies to flourish unchecked. In a world increasingly polarized by conflict, he urged for a proactive stance against radical Islam, advocating for decisive action rather than succumbing to a defeatist mentality.

Obama's address served as a call to action for the global community to confront the realities of radical extremism with a comprehensive strategy that transcends military solutions. By promoting diplomacy, humanitarian efforts, and political resolutions, he proposed a more nuanced approach to combating the ideologies that underpin groups like ISIS.

The former president's remarks have sparked discussions on the effectiveness of current strategies in addressing extremism. His insistence on the importance of honesty in acknowledging the challenges posed by radical ideologies has resonated with many who share concerns about the trajectory of global security.

As the world grapples with the complexities of combating terrorism and extremism, Obama's address at the U.N. Assembly serves as a reminder of the importance of a multifaceted approach that prioritizes diplomatic engagement and community resilience. In a time of uncertainty, his call for decisive action against radical ideologies remains a crucial part of the conversation on global security and peace-building efforts.",-5.0,10.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,494.0,0.5263157894736842,0.020242914979757085
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents have shed light on the U.S. government's understanding of the rise of ISIS, indicating that both the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) anticipated the emergence of the group as early as 2012. These revelations have sparked significant debate regarding the Obama Administration's role in the unfolding crisis in the Middle East.

The documents suggest that the administration may have inadvertently contributed to the creation of ISIS as part of a strategy to isolate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. Investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed argues that Western powers, in collaboration with Gulf states and Turkey, intentionally supported violent Islamist factions to destabilize Assad, fully aware that such actions could lead to the establishment of an Islamic State in the region.

Critics have pointed to President Obama's characterization of ISIS as a ""JV"" team, arguing that this dismissive assessment, coupled with the decision not to maintain a residual military presence in Iraq, were tactical errors that had profound consequences. The documents predict that Western support for Takfiri militants would ultimately result in the formation of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria, a forecast that has now been realized.

Moreover, the documents provide troubling insights into U.S. arms operations in Libya prior to the 2012 Benghazi attack, revealing that U.S. intelligence agencies were aware of weapons being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports. This raises serious questions about the administration's handling of security and intelligence in the region, particularly regarding the safety of U.S. servicemen and personnel in Benghazi, who may have been sacrificed due to a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that facilitated the rise of ISIS.

The report concludes with accusations against the Obama Administration for prioritizing the concealment of critical facts over national security, suggesting that the implications of these policies have had lasting repercussions in the Middle East and beyond. As the debate continues, these revelations underscore the complexities and unintended consequences of foreign policy decisions in a volatile region.",-27.0,-14.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,374.0,-1.4,-0.0374331550802139
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling incident during the 9/11 ceremony in New York City, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her waiting van. This unexpected event has ignited a wave of speculation regarding her health and capability to fulfill her duties as a presidential candidate.

Witnesses reported that Clinton appeared faint and unsteady before being assisted out of the ceremony. Shortly after the incident, she resurfaced at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, where observers noted a striking transformation in her appearance. Those present remarked that she seemed noticeably different, exhibiting a more energetic demeanor and a lighter presence compared to her earlier appearance at the ceremony.

Further scrutiny of her appearance revealed changes that have drawn significant attention. Observers pointed out a notable alteration in the shape of her nose, which they described as resembling a ""Roman type,"" a stark contrast to her previously recognized ""Nordic nose."" Additionally, some noted the absence of a mole above her lip, a distinguishing feature that has long been associated with the real Hillary Clinton.

As the details of her collapse and subsequent reappearance circulate, speculation has intensified regarding Clinton's ability to participate in the upcoming debates against her rival, Donald Trump. The questions surrounding her health have led to broader concerns about the potential implications for her campaign and, if elected, her administration.

Moreover, there are growing fears that a stand-in version of Hillary could conduct public appearances and official duties if she were to win the election. This scenario raises significant questions about the authenticity of her presidency, leading some to speculate that her administration might be primarily run by her cabinet, with the stand-in serving merely as a figurehead. Such a situation would mark a dramatic departure from traditional expectations of presidential leadership.

The implications of this possibility have not gone unnoticed. Observers have drawn parallels to previous speculations regarding President Obama, suggesting that the current situation could render those discussions minor in comparison. The notion that Clinton's administration could be the first in which she is not actively in charge has prompted serious concerns among political analysts and the public alike.

As these discussions unfold, the focus remains on the implications of Clinton's health and the authenticity of her candidacy. The potential for a stand-in to assume her public role raises pressing questions about the integrity of the electoral process and the nature of leadership in the highest office of the land.

The author of this article expresses deep concern regarding the implications of such a scenario for American democracy. The idea that a candidate might not be fully present to lead, should they win the presidency, is troubling and merits serious consideration as the nation approaches the critical election period.

These developments have sparked intense debate across social media platforms and news outlets, with many calling for greater transparency regarding Clinton's health and fitness for office. As the election draws nearer, voters are left to ponder the ramifications of a leadership structure that may not align with traditional expectations of accountability and presence.

In conclusion, the events surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and the subsequent speculation about her candidacy have raised significant questions about the future of her campaign. The concerns about a potential stand-in conducting official duties could redefine the nature of presidential leadership in America, prompting a reevaluation of what voters expect from their elected officials. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of these developments will undoubtedly remain a focal point of discussion in the lead-up to the election.",8.0,29.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,660.0,1.16,0.04393939393939394
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Rumors are swirling around former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with reports suggesting she may be experiencing a nervous breakdown. Recent footage has surfaced showing Clinton seemingly losing control of her eye movements, raising alarms among supporters and critics alike. This incident has prompted Clinton to cancel a scheduled fundraiser in North Carolina, further fueling concerns about her health and campaign viability.

Between September 20 and October 19, Clinton has only one rally on her calendar, with no speaking engagements lined up for fundraisers. This stark contrast to her political rival, Donald Trump, who has four rallies planned during the same period, has led to increased scrutiny regarding Clinton’s ability to maintain an active campaign presence.

Health concerns surrounding Clinton have been a topic of discussion for some time. An alarming incident in which she required Secret Service assistance to navigate two steps has only intensified these worries. As speculation mounts, sources suggest that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is exploring potential replacements for Clinton, highlighting the precarious situation facing the party.

Adding to the complexity of the Democrats’ predicament is the perception that Bernie Sanders is unwilling to enter the presidential race. This reluctance complicates the DNC's search for alternatives, leaving Clinton positioned as the primary candidate despite the emerging health issues that could hinder her campaign.

The DNC has publicly backed Clinton, but there are claims that her health challenges will soon become more apparent, potentially vindicating conspiracy theories regarding her condition. As the political landscape continues to evolve, observers are keenly watching for further developments in Clinton's health and campaign strategy.

In the coming days, it is expected that more information will emerge regarding Clinton's situation and the DNC's response to the growing concerns. The political stakes are high, and as the election cycle progresses, the ability of the Democrats to present a united front will be tested. With the spotlight firmly on Clinton, the implications of her health and campaign decisions could have significant ramifications for the party's future.",-8.0,-4.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,389.0,-0.26666666666666666,-0.010282776349614395
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In the quiet hours of a late night, a restless Barack Obama found himself grappling with insomnia. The usual tranquility of the White House was disrupted by an unexpected and loud distraction: his wife, Michelle, snoring. This cacophony of nighttime noises drove him from the comfort of his bed and into the dimly lit corridors of the West Wing, where thoughts swirled like the shadows around him.

As he wandered through the historic halls, a singular idea began to take form in his mind. In a moment of inspiration, he found a Post-It note and wrote down a word that would soon become infamous: ""ISIS."" Little did he know, this word would evolve into a concept that would shape international relations for years to come.

Months later, the Coachella music festival provided a vibrant backdrop for the budding idea. Amidst the pulsating beats of electronic music and the carefree revelry of festival-goers, the atmosphere was electric. It was here, surrounded by a sea of colorful lights and youthful exuberance, that Obama’s thoughts about ISIS began to crystallize. The party ambiance invigorated him, and the notion of forming an international terrorist organization began to take root in his mind.

Initially, when Obama shared his audacious ambition with those around him, he was met with disbelief. The idea of a former president wanting to establish a terrorist group seemed far-fetched, even for the most open-minded of his peers. However, the gravity of his vision weighed heavily on him, and he sought out a confidante who could understand the complexities of his thoughts.

In a candid moment in the kitchen, Obama turned to Hillary Clinton, sharing his secret aspirations. The conversation that unfolded was as shocking as it was humorous. Obama, in a bizarre twist, claimed to have been born in Kenya in 1919. This revelation was met with a mix of disbelief and confusion from Hillary, who struggled to grasp the implications of what he was saying.

The dialogue took a light-hearted turn as they exchanged quips about Obama’s dog, Bo, humorously suggesting that he was a supercomputer capable of processing complex strategies for world domination. This whimsical banter provided a brief respite from the gravity of their discussion, allowing them to bond over the absurdity of the situation.

As they continued their conversation, the atmosphere shifted, leading them out to the serene confines of the Rose Garden. The tranquility of the garden offered a stark contrast to the weighty subject matter they were discussing. Here, in the midst of blooming flowers and lush greenery, they contemplated the future of the proposed terrorist organization.

Hillary, ever the strategist, suggested a more calculated approach: waiting until she ascended to the presidency before they moved forward with their covert plans to dismantle America from within. This proposition thrilled Obama, who saw in it a kindred spirit willing to entertain the most outlandish of ideas.

The night concluded with a sense of camaraderie and understanding between the two leaders. In a world where they were often seen as adversaries, this shared moment of levity and ambition forged a bond that transcended their political personas. They had ventured into the realm of the absurd, yet emerged with a newfound respect for each other’s willingness to entertain the unconventional.

As the stars twinkled overhead, the implications of their conversation lingered in the air. What had begun as a sleepless night filled with distractions had transformed into a night of revelations, where laughter and ambition intertwined in the most unexpected of ways. The seeds of an idea that would soon captivate the world had been sown, all under the watchful gaze of the Rose Garden, where dreams and schemes often collide in the corridors of power.",-4.0,19.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,717.0,0.6333333333333333,0.026499302649930265
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the realm of political campaigning, promises are often made with the fervor of conviction, yet the reality of governance frequently reveals a stark contrast to those declarations. Frank Wilkenmeyer, in a recent discussion, highlighted this phenomenon by referencing George H.W. Bush's infamous ""no new taxes"" pledge, which ultimately crumbled under the weight of fiscal necessity. This historical context serves as a backdrop for examining Donald Trump’s latest vow to ""destroy"" terrorism in America, a promise that raises significant concerns about its feasibility and implications.

In the wake of recent attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, Trump’s statement resonated with a populace grappling with fear and uncertainty. However, the specifics of his declaration remain worryingly vague. What does “destroying” terrorism entail? While the intention may be rooted in a desire for security, the lack of clarity suggests that extreme measures could be on the table. This ambiguity is particularly troubling given the potential for such a stance to foster an environment of fear and division.

Trump's rhetoric has not only been focused on the threats posed by terrorism but has also included personal attacks directed at President Obama and Secretary Clinton. Such tactics, while not uncommon in political discourse, detract from a substantive discussion on how to effectively combat terrorism. Instead of fostering a collaborative approach to national security, Trump’s comments seem to deepen partisan divides, making it more difficult to forge a united front against a common enemy.

The implications of Trump’s promise extend beyond mere political rivalry. Critics have raised alarms about the potential consequences of his approach, particularly regarding the treatment of Muslim communities in America. The fear is that Trump's plan could lead to increased profiling of Muslims, infringing upon their civil liberties and rights. The erosion of due process rights, a cornerstone of American democracy, could become a casualty in the quest for security under Trump's administration.

Moreover, the specter of enhanced surveillance and the segregation of Muslim communities looms large. History has shown that fear can lead to the scapegoating of entire groups, and Trump’s rhetoric may inadvertently pave the way for a more divided society. Such an approach echoes troubling chapters from history, where fear-driven policies resulted in the marginalization of specific communities. For those knowledgeable about these historical precedents, Trump's language and promises evoke a sense of alarm.

The article posits that Trump's rhetoric, with its undertones of authoritarianism, leans dangerously towards fascism. The idea that a leader can promise to “destroy” an abstract concept like terrorism without a clear and humane strategy is reminiscent of regimes that have prioritized power over the rights of individuals. The potential for a slippery slope, wherein civil liberties are sacrificed on the altar of national security, is a concern that should not be taken lightly.

In conclusion, while the desire to combat terrorism is a noble one, Trump’s promise appears unrealistic when juxtaposed with the complexities of governance and the realities of international relations. The comparison to George H.W. Bush’s failed political pledge serves as a poignant reminder that campaign promises often fall short of their lofty ambitions. As the nation grapples with the multifaceted challenges of terrorism, it is imperative that leaders articulate plans that prioritize both security and the preservation of civil liberties. Without this balance, the promise to “destroy” terrorism may ultimately lead to more harm than good, leaving a legacy of division and fear in its wake.",-28.0,-27.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,669.0,-0.9642857142857143,-0.04035874439461883
Fake_24-Webpage,Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence ⋆ US Herald,"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component.

In a stark warning, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno has highlighted a precarious tipping point for national security, citing the increasing threats posed by global terrorism and hostilities from nations such as the Soviet Union and North Korea. Odierno's remarks underscore a growing concern within military ranks regarding the current state of readiness and the implications of further military reductions.

Odierno pointed out that the Army is currently only generating sufficient readiness to address immediate operational needs. He cautioned against any additional cuts to military forces, arguing that such reductions could jeopardize the Army's ability to respond effectively to evolving global threats. 

The general emphasized a significant disconnect between military leadership and the administration, a gap that he asserts began during the Obama Administration. This disconnect, according to Odierno, contributed to the rise of ISIS, as military commanders' strategies and recommendations were often overlooked. He criticized the administration for disregarding the insights of military leaders, which he believes has had detrimental effects on military careers and operational effectiveness.

Odierno articulated that the nation is navigating through enormous challenges, describing the current moment as a strategic inflection point. He warned that determined global adversaries are increasingly threatening national security, necessitating a robust and responsive military posture.

The Army has already faced substantial reductions, having decreased its active force by 80,000 soldiers and eliminated 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades. These cuts, coupled with a 25% decrease in investment for modernization, have raised alarms within military circles. Essential programs, including infantry fighting vehicle upgrades and scout helicopter development, are now at risk due to these funding constraints.

As the Army grapples with these challenges, Odierno's insights serve as a clarion call for renewed focus on military readiness and strategic investment, urging policymakers to consider the implications of their decisions on the nation's security landscape.",-4.0,-9.0,364.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.01098901098901099,357.0,-0.6923076923076923,-0.025210084033613446

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.



Right now, the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many Americans don’t know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it’s too late!

Fake_26-Webpage,Clemson BANS Memes Featuring Dead Gorilla Harambe…Promotes “Rape Culture” and “Racism” – Eagle Rising,"Clemson University freshmen may no longer publicly display Harambe-related memes because they “add to rape culture” and can be “a form of racism.”

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the nation approaches critical elections, the integrity of the electoral process is under the spotlight. Every state has established laws governing election methods and procedures, yet concerns are rising regarding the potential for manipulation and fraud. The National Democratic Party has faced serious accusations, with critics claiming that it is attempting to undermine the democratic process through various illegal means.

The author of this article presents a stark warning, alleging that the Democratic Party's ultimate goal is to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States. This assertion is backed by claims of voter fraud and ballot stuffing, particularly in relation to the 2016 presidential election, where it is alleged that these tactics were employed to secure a victory for Hillary Clinton. Such allegations raise significant concerns about the fairness of elections and the need for stringent measures to protect the electoral process.

A fundamental aspect of ensuring fair elections is the verification of voter eligibility. The author advocates for the implementation of photo identification laws, which would require voters to present valid ID before casting their ballots. This measure is deemed essential to prevent ineligible individuals from participating in elections. However, the Democratic Party has been accused of opposing voter ID laws, a stance that critics argue is aimed at allowing ineligible voters to influence election outcomes.

The article goes further to criticize not only the Democratic Party but also the Obama administration, Congress, and the federal court system for what the author describes as a concerted effort to suppress fair election laws. This criticism highlights a perceived failure among these institutions to uphold the integrity of the electoral process and protect citizens' rights to a fair vote.

In light of these allegations, the author calls upon citizens to take an active role in safeguarding democracy by volunteering to monitor polling places. This grassroots initiative is presented as a crucial step in preventing voter fraud and ensuring that elections are conducted fairly. By empowering individuals to oversee the electoral process, the author believes that the potential for manipulation can be significantly reduced.

The article also portrays Donald Trump in a positive light, emphasizing his commitment to the country and his dedication to preserving the republic. As the nation gears up for the November 8, 2016 election, the author underscores the importance of this event as a pivotal moment in the fight for democracy. Citizens are urged to take action, not only by voting but also by actively participating in efforts to ensure a fair election and prevent what are perceived as fraudulent practices by the Democratic Party.

The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the publication. However, the urgency of the message resonates with many who are concerned about the future of the electoral process in the United States. As the election date approaches, the call for vigilance and active participation in safeguarding democracy serves as a reminder of the responsibilities that come with citizenship.

In conclusion, the integrity of elections is a cornerstone of democracy, and the current climate surrounding the electoral process demands attention and action. The accusations against the National Democratic Party and the call for voter ID laws highlight the ongoing debate about election security and fairness. As citizens prepare to cast their votes, the emphasis on monitoring polling places and advocating for transparent election practices underscores the critical role that individuals play in preserving the democratic process. The upcoming election is not just a political event; it is a defining moment for the republic, and citizens are encouraged to engage actively in ensuring that their voices are heard and that their votes count.",-52.0,-3.0,678.0,-3.466666666666667,-0.07669616519174041,681.0,-0.12,-0.004405286343612335
Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the realm of political advertising, few images are as iconic and haunting as the 1964 commercial featuring a young girl picking daisies, set against the backdrop of a nuclear explosion. This ad, approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson, aimed to portray his opponent, Barry Goldwater, as a reckless warmonger, ready to plunge the nation into nuclear war. The stark contrast between innocence and destruction captured the public's attention and played a pivotal role in shaping perceptions during a tumultuous election year.

Today, as we navigate the complexities of modern politics, one cannot help but draw parallels between the past and present. Johnson's ad, while a product of its time, serves as a reminder of how political narratives can be constructed to sway public opinion. Despite Johnson's own controversial Vietnam policies, the ad effectively redirected the narrative towards Goldwater, framing him as a dangerous choice for America. 

In this contemporary landscape, the question arises: what would a modern equivalent of the ""Daisy"" ad look like? The author suggests that a remake could focus on the failures of Hillary Clinton, potentially posing a significant threat to her campaign. As the 2024 election cycle heats up, Clinton's team may find themselves in a precarious position, as they grapple with her past decisions and the perception of her leadership.

Rumors have begun to circulate about a potential ""Daisy"" remake specifically targeting Donald Trump. Such a move could be indicative of desperation among Clinton's staff, as they seek to craft a narrative that resonates with voters who may be increasingly skeptical of her candidacy. The idea of revisiting such a powerful advertising trope speaks to the urgency felt by political operatives who understand the weight that visuals and emotional appeals carry in the minds of voters.

Yet, in this age of information saturation, voters are often distracted by misleading media narratives. The case of Ted Cruz serves as a prime example. Recently, Cruz has undergone a political shift that has left many questioning his motivations and integrity. The media's selective reporting on his past criticisms of Trump, juxtaposed with Trump's retaliatory insults, reveals a bias that can skew public perception. 

This bias in journalism is not new, but it is particularly pronounced in the current political climate. The tendency to bury critical details about candidates, especially those who may not align with a certain ideological perspective, raises concerns about the integrity of the information voters receive. The author critiques this trend, emphasizing the need for a more balanced approach to political reporting that holds all candidates accountable for their past statements and actions.

In the context of Hillary Clinton, it is essential to remember the criticisms that emerged during the 2008 primaries. Barack Obama and Michelle Obama were vocal about their concerns regarding Clinton's candidacy, and these past statements should not be overlooked. The selective memory of the electorate, often influenced by the media's narrative framing, poses a challenge for Clinton as she seeks to distance herself from her past while appealing to a new generation of voters.

The article concludes with a provocative suggestion: a new version of the daisy commercial that documents Clinton's shortcomings could be more impactful than the original ad. By leveraging the emotional resonance of the original while highlighting the realities of Clinton's political journey, such an ad could cut through the noise of modern political discourse. It would not only serve as a reminder of the stakes involved but also challenge voters to confront the complexities of their choices.

Ultimately, the views expressed in this article represent the author's perspective and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the publication. As we approach the next election cycle, the power of political advertising remains undeniable, and the lessons of the past continue to inform the strategies of today. Whether through a modern reinterpretation of the ""Daisy"" ad or other innovative approaches, the quest for effective political communication remains at the forefront of electoral politics.",-18.0,-7.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,757.0,-0.25,-0.009247027741083224

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

Fake_3-Webpage,Why is it “RACIST” to Question Someone’s Birth Certificate? – Eagle Rising,"The Democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly. If you question the veracity of a black president’s birth certificate you are racist. That is the outright claim of Lynn Sweet Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times made on Fox News. Consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist. What is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur?

First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification. Has an unquestioned birth certificate ever been presented? No, only a cry of racism when the request is made.

In a recent discussion, Lynn Sweet, the Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, claimed that questioning President Obama's birth certificate is inherently racist, particularly given that he is a black president. However, this assertion has sparked debate, with critics arguing that it represents a non-sequitur.

Several points of contention have arisen regarding the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate. Critics highlight evidence suggesting that the document presented may have been altered. Furthermore, there are questions surrounding Obama's social security number, which was issued in Connecticut, a state where he has no known residence. Additionally, the hospital cited on the birth certificate reportedly did not exist at the time the document was supposedly issued, raising further doubts about its authenticity. Errors within the birth certificate itself could also indicate potential falsification.

The author of the article questions whether an original birth certificate has ever been made public and criticizes the reliance on accusations of racism rather than presenting tangible evidence to support claims about the document's validity. 

This discourse has not only highlighted the complexities surrounding the birth certificate issue but has also pointed out that figures like Donald Trump have seemingly succumbed to these contentious tactics.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The article discusses a homophobic attack on Aaron Woods, a homosexual man, in May 2016 in Eastbourne.

- The article critiques the perceived compatibility between the gay community and Islamic followers, highlighting Shariah law's stance on homosexuality.

In May 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual man, became the victim of a brutal homophobic attack in Eastbourne that has raised serious concerns about the safety of LGBTQ+ individuals in the area. Woods was approached by an assailant who hurled homophobic slurs before physically assaulting him, resulting in a broken jaw. Eyewitnesses reported that during the attack, the assailant shouted phrases that included ""Muslim stuff,"" a detail that has fueled discussions about the intersection of faith and sexual orientation.

Woods, described by a friend as a gentle person, was reportedly attacked with a knuckleduster, leaving him with significant injuries and a traumatic experience. The attack on Woods is not an isolated incident; around the same time, a gay couple in nearby Brighton faced a similar assault, highlighting a troubling pattern of violence against members of the LGBTQ+ community in the region.

Sgt. Peter Allan expressed his sadness over the recent homophobic assaults, acknowledging the distress these incidents have caused within the community. However, he noted that the victims were on the path to recovery and that arrests had been made in connection with the attacks. The response from law enforcement underscores the commitment to addressing hate crimes and supporting those affected.

The incidents have sparked a broader conversation about the compatibility of the gay community with certain interpretations of Islamic beliefs. Critics point to Shariah law, which traditionally condemns homosexuality, as a significant barrier to coexistence. This perspective contrasts sharply with the views of some American Muslims, who have shown a more accepting attitude toward LGBTQ+ individuals. 

The author of the article argues that radical interpretations of Islam fundamentally oppose the values of the gay community, as exemplified by the harrowing experience of Woods. The juxtaposition of these two worlds raises critical questions about safety, acceptance, and the potential for violence against marginalized groups.

As communities continue to grapple with these issues, the hope remains that dialogue and understanding can pave the way for a more inclusive society, free from the fear of violence based on sexual orientation. However, the stark reality of attacks like that on Aaron Woods serves as a chilling reminder of the challenges that lie ahead.",-26.0,-41.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,415.0,-2.5625,-0.09879518072289156
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

On a Saturday night that began like any other, chaos erupted at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota, when a man dressed in a security uniform launched a brutal attack on unsuspecting shoppers. The assailant, later identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and Muslim, reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" as he stabbed nine individuals. The shocking incident sent ripples of fear through the community and raised critical questions about safety, identity, and the influence of extremist ideologies.

Witnesses recounted the harrowing moments of the attack, during which Adan was seen asking at least one of his victims whether they were Muslim before he struck. This detail has led to speculation about the motivations behind his actions and whether they were rooted in a distorted interpretation of faith. The St. Cloud Somali-American community quickly identified Adan as the perpetrator, and in a troubling twist, ISIS later claimed him as one of their own, further complicating the narrative surrounding the attack.

The timing of the incident was particularly alarming, occurring shortly after a series of other terror-related events, including a bomb explosion at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey and a meat cleaver attack on police officers in New York. These incidents have heightened concerns about the growing threat of domestic terrorism and the potential for radicalization within immigrant communities.

In the wake of the attack, members of the St. Cloud Somali community expressed their shock and sadness, rallying around Adan’s family. They described him as a good man and an accomplished student, emphasizing that his actions were not representative of their community. This sentiment highlights the complex reality faced by Somali immigrants in Minnesota, many of whom have worked hard to build a life in the U.S. while grappling with the stigma that can arise from the actions of a few.

The swift response of law enforcement was pivotal in preventing further bloodshed. Officer Jason Falconer, who was off-duty at the time, intervened and shot Adan, ultimately killing him during the attack. The mayor of St. Cloud hailed Falconer as a hero, commending his bravery and quick thinking in a life-threatening situation. His actions undoubtedly saved lives, but they also underscored the inherent risks that law enforcement officers face daily.

As the investigation unfolded, concerns emerged regarding the targeting of Somali immigrants by terrorist organizations like ISIS and Al-Shabaab for recruitment. Reports have indicated a troubling history of Somali refugees in Minnesota facing various threats, including attempts to join Islamist groups. This has led to a broader discussion about the vulnerabilities of immigrant communities and the need for effective measures to counter radicalization.

The Somali-American community in Minnesota has been the focus of scrutiny in recent years, with several individuals being convicted for attempting to join ISIS. Additionally, there have been attempts by Al-Shabaab to collaborate with ISIS, further complicating the landscape of extremist threats. These incidents have raised alarms about the potential for further radicalization within the community and the challenges of integration in a post-9/11 America.

The article also touched upon the broader context of refugee resettlement in the U.S., noting that over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. This influx has sparked debates about immigration policies and the implications for national security. Critics have warned that increasing the number of Muslim refugees could lead to heightened terror threats, a sentiment that resonates with some segments of the population.

The attack in St. Cloud serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding immigration, identity, and the potential for extremism. It highlights the need for communities to come together in the face of adversity while also addressing the underlying issues that can lead to violence and radicalization. As the St. Cloud community grapples with the aftermath of the attack, the focus must remain on healing and understanding, rather than division and fear.

In the coming weeks, community leaders and law enforcement agencies will likely engage in discussions about safety measures and community outreach programs aimed at preventing future incidents. The hope is that by fostering dialogue and understanding, the St. Cloud community can emerge stronger and more united in the face of adversity.

As the investigation continues and the community processes the trauma of the attack, the broader implications of the incident will undoubtedly linger. Questions about the role of extremist ideologies, the responsibilities of immigrant communities, and the effectiveness of counter-radicalization efforts will remain at the forefront of public discourse.

In the aftermath of this tragic event, it is essential to remember the victims and their families, as well as the heroism displayed by those who intervened. The St. Cloud mall attack serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of safety in today's world and the ongoing challenges that communities face in addressing the threat of terrorism while nurturing a spirit of inclusivity and understanding.

As the community reflects on this dark chapter, it is crucial to prioritize healing and resilience, ensuring that the values of compassion and unity prevail over fear and division. The road ahead may be challenging, but with collective effort and understanding, the St. Cloud community can work towards a future that honors the dignity of all its members, regardless of their background.",-72.0,-51.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,981.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.05198776758409786
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In recent years, the Millennial generation has often been characterized as the ""everyone gets a trophy generation,"" a label that suggests a culture of entitlement and victimhood. This characterization takes on a more complex dimension when examining the case of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the New Jersey and New York City bombings. Rahami's narrative includes claims of victimhood that stemmed from his experiences as a Muslim in America, particularly regarding allegations of ""Islamophobia.""

Rahami, alongside his father, took legal action against the police in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 2011, alleging discrimination based on their religion. The lawsuit claimed that local law enforcement engaged in ""selective enforcement"" against their family, specifically targeting their restaurant, First American Fried Chicken, with what they described as baseless tickets. This legal battle highlighted the family's grievances with local officials, painting a picture of a community where they felt marginalized.

The Rahami family reported experiencing racial abuse from local residents, with statements like ""Muslims don’t belong here"" underscoring the tensions that can arise in diverse communities. These allegations of discrimination and abuse were central to their lawsuit, which sought to address what they perceived as a systemic bias against them. However, Mayor Christian Bollwage refuted the claims of discrimination, asserting that the complaints against the Rahami family were rooted in legitimate issues such as noise and street congregation problems, rather than any bias against their religion.

Despite their efforts, the lawsuit was unsuccessful, and the grievances Rahami expressed did not lead to a constructive resolution. Instead, they culminated in violent actions that shocked the nation and brought his narrative into a far darker light. The transformation of Rahami's claims of victimhood into acts of violence raises troubling questions about the intersection of personal grievances, societal perceptions, and individual actions.

Critics argue that Rahami's case reflects broader societal issues in America, particularly the challenges faced by Muslim communities in the wake of heightened scrutiny and prejudice. The tension between claims of victimhood and the resort to violence illustrates a failure to bridge understanding and resolve conflicts through dialogue. This situation serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of feeling marginalized and the potential for such feelings to manifest in destructive ways.

As the nation grapples with the implications of Rahami's actions, it is crucial to reflect on the narratives we construct around victimhood and the responsibilities that come with them. The story of Ahmad Khan Rahami is not just about an individual; it is emblematic of the struggles faced by many in a society that often finds itself divided along lines of race, religion, and identity. In understanding these dynamics, there lies an opportunity for growth, healing, and ultimately, a more inclusive society.",-38.0,-41.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,534.0,-2.2777777777777777,-0.07677902621722846
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers in America have historically threatened to relocate if workers don't vote in their favor.

As the political landscape heats up ahead of the upcoming elections, a familiar narrative is emerging: employers in America are once again wielding the threat of relocation and job loss to influence the voting behavior of their workers. This tactic, often referred to as economic coercion, has a long history in the United States, where businesses have sought to sway employee votes in favor of their interests, particularly during pivotal election cycles.

Despite the pressure to align their votes with employer preferences, many workers find themselves in precarious situations. Even when they comply, casting their ballots in favor of corporate interests, the reality remains grim. Job outsourcing continues to plague the workforce, wages remain stagnant, and enforcement of regulations designed to protect employees is often lax. The promise of support from employers often evaporates in the face of these ongoing challenges, leaving workers to grapple with the consequences of decisions made at the corporate level.

A notable figure in this ongoing saga is Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, who has recently made headlines for his bold statements regarding the potential economic repercussions of a Democratic victory in the upcoming election. Puzder's threats echo those of other corporate leaders, such as former CEO ""Papa"" John Schnatter, who previously warned that he would cut hours and raise prices if the Affordable Care Act was enacted. However, Schnatter ultimately did not follow through on his threats, raising questions about the sincerity of such claims.

Puzder's position is particularly striking as he has announced his intention to fully automate his restaurants should a Democrat win the election. He cites rising labor costs as the driving factor behind this decision, suggesting that automation is a necessary response to an increasingly expensive workforce. His vision for the future of dining includes models similar to Eatsa, where customers interact with kiosks to place their orders, bypassing the need for human staff altogether.

In his arguments against raising the minimum wage, Puzder posits a controversial perspective: that higher wages for some could lead to job losses for others. This assertion raises fundamental questions about the balance between fair compensation and employment opportunities, a debate that has become central to discussions about labor rights and economic policy in recent years.

With a workforce of approximately 20,000 employees, Puzder is not only a significant player in the fast-food industry but also a key influencer among minimum wage workers. His rhetoric seeks to persuade them to vote against their own interests, framing the election outcome as a direct threat to their livelihoods. This manipulation of worker sentiment is emblematic of a broader trend where corporate leaders attempt to shape political outcomes in ways that prioritize profit over people.

Puzder’s influence extends beyond his corporate role, as he actively runs a political blog that promotes capitalism and free-market principles. However, this raises critical questions about the satisfaction and well-being of his employees under his leadership. Reports indicate that while Puzder has enjoyed substantial financial success—earning nearly $4.5 million in 2012, with profits continuing to rise—his employees have not seen similar benefits.

Regardless of the election's outcome, Puzder's commitment to automation seems unwavering. His focus on technology and efficiency suggests a prioritization of profits over the workforce that sustains his business. As the election approaches, the implications of such corporate strategies will likely resonate throughout the labor market, influencing not only the immediate economic landscape but also the long-term dynamics of employment in America.

As workers navigate the pressures of the upcoming election, the interplay between corporate interests and employee rights remains a critical issue. The tactics employed by leaders like Puzder highlight the ongoing struggle for workers to assert their rights and advocate for fair treatment in an increasingly automated and profit-driven economy.",21.0,32.0,642.0,0.8076923076923077,0.03271028037383177,712.0,1.28,0.0449438202247191
Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category

In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a development that has reignited discussions surrounding Hillary Clinton's controversial use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State, the FBI is now investigating new evidence that has emerged from a separate inquiry into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin. This investigation has uncovered a shared laptop between Abedin and Weiner, which may hold ""tens of thousands of emails,"" including those forwarded from Clinton's account. The implications of these findings could be significant, potentially placing both Clinton and Abedin in jeopardy of legal repercussions if the emails are found to be work-related or classified. 

The timing of the FBI's letter, which disclosed these serious findings just 11 days before the presidential election, has raised eyebrows and intensified scrutiny on the agency's actions. This latest revelation comes on the heels of a tumultuous summer for Clinton, during which FBI Director James Comey publicly outlined the evidence against her in July 2016 but ultimately chose not to recommend charges. This decision left many within the FBI dissatisfied, leading to a growing sentiment among certain officials that Clinton's security clearance should be revoked and that she should face prosecution.

A recently released 100-page FBI summary has shed light on the complexities of the investigation and the various pressures involved. The summary reveals that a State Department official allegedly pressured the FBI to declassify information in exchange for the deployment of additional agents to diplomatic posts, a claim that both the State Department and the FBI have denied. Additionally, the summary mentions a clandestine group of State Department officials dubbed ""The Shadow Government,"" who were reportedly discussing Freedom of Information requests related to Clinton's emails. This raises further questions about the security protocols during Clinton's time in office and the potential for breaches of sensitive information.

The investigation has also drawn attention to the actions of Clinton's supporters, including a significant donation of nearly $500,000 to the wife of an FBI official involved in the inquiry into Clinton's email practices. This financial connection has led to allegations of bias and raised concerns about the integrity of the investigation itself.

Central to the controversy is Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who played a pivotal role in the deletion of over 33,000 emails from Clinton's private server. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department, a move that has sparked criticism and questions about the motivations behind the deletions. New evidence suggests that some of the deleted emails included communications with President Obama, contradicting his previous claims of being unaware of Clinton's use of a private email server for official business.

Leaked emails have further complicated the narrative, indicating that Clinton personally deleted many emails without oversight. This raises serious concerns regarding her intent and the legality of her actions. The FBI's earlier decision not to charge Clinton was predicated on a perceived lack of intent; however, the emergence of new evidence could potentially alter this assessment.

The implications of a cover-up involving the White House to shield Clinton from scrutiny have also surfaced, suggesting that there may have been efforts to prevent the disclosure of sensitive communications. As the investigation unfolds, the timeline of events surrounding the email controversy has become increasingly critical. Key moments include the initial New York Times report that first brought the issue to light, as well as the subsequent actions taken by Clinton and her associates to delete evidence in the wake of the growing scandal.

As the FBI delves deeper into this new evidence, the ramifications for Clinton, Abedin, and potentially even the Obama administration loom large. The investigation not only threatens to undermine Clinton's political aspirations but also raises fundamental questions about accountability, transparency, and the integrity of government officials in handling classified information. 

With the election looming and the stakes higher than ever, the unfolding saga of Clinton's email server may yet prove to be a pivotal moment in American political history, one that could redefine the boundaries of acceptable conduct for those in power. As the FBI continues its investigation, the nation watches closely, awaiting answers and accountability in a case that has captivated and polarized the public for years. 

In the coming weeks, as more information is revealed and the implications of the new evidence become clearer, the political landscape may shift dramatically. The potential for charges against Clinton and Abedin could alter the dynamics of the election and reshape public perception of both candidates. With the FBI's actions under scrutiny and the investigation's findings yet to be fully disclosed, the fallout from this controversy is far from over. 

As the nation grapples with these developments, the question remains: what will the future hold for Hillary Clinton and those involved in this intricate web of political intrigue? Only time will tell as the investigation unfolds, revealing layers of complexity in a story that continues to captivate the American public.",-6.0,-25.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,919.0,-0.8333333333333334,-0.02720348204570185
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

In a significant shift in stance, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has publicly acknowledged her mistakes regarding the country's refugee policy, particularly in light of the ongoing migrant crisis. Merkel, who previously advocated for an open borders policy to accept Syrian refugees, is now facing mounting criticism from the German public, which has expressed its discontent through a decisive electoral outcome that saw her conservative Democrat party voted out of power by a large margin.

The influx of refugees into Germany has been accompanied by a notable increase in crime rates, including thousands of reported sexual assaults and violent crimes. This surge in criminal activity has fueled discontent among citizens and has prompted a reevaluation of Merkel's approach to immigration and multiculturalism. At a recent party conference, Merkel described multiculturalism as a “living lie,” signaling a significant departure from her earlier, more liberal stance.

In her remarks, Merkel emphasized the necessity of controlling the influx of migrants to manage the situation effectively. She outlined her commitment to reducing the number of refugees entering Germany and indicated that the country must regulate and limit migration at various levels. While she received applause for her change in position, Merkel stopped short of committing to a specific limit on refugee arrivals, leaving many questions unanswered about the future of Germany's immigration policy.

The implications of Merkel's shift in policy extend beyond Germany's borders, raising concerns about similar issues in other countries, including the United States. As leaders around the world grapple with the challenges of immigration and integration, Merkel's experience serves as a cautionary tale about the complexities and potential pitfalls of open border policies.

As Germany navigates this critical juncture, the political landscape is poised for further changes, with the public's reaction likely to shape future policies and the broader discourse on immigration in Europe and beyond. Merkel's acknowledgment of her past errors reflects a growing recognition of the need for a more balanced and controlled approach to immigration, one that prioritizes both humanitarian concerns and the safety and security of citizens.",-2.0,-7.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,393.0,-0.5833333333333334,-0.017811704834605598

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or

In a striking revelation, a terrorist convicted of planting explosives in New Jersey and New York City is poised to receive superior medical care compared to U.S. veterans. This situation has ignited a wave of criticism and concern regarding the priorities of the American healthcare system, particularly in relation to those who have served the nation.

Former President Donald Trump seized the opportunity to address this alarming disparity during a recent campaign speech. He condemned the notion that a terrorist would have access to top-notch medical facilities, modern hospital care, and legal representation while many veterans continue to struggle with inadequate healthcare services. Trump’s remarks echoed a broader sentiment among Americans who feel that the system is failing those who have sacrificed for their country.

The controversy surrounding the treatment of veterans is not new. A 2014 scandal involving the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) exposed significant inefficiencies within the system, including long waiting lists for medical appointments and substandard care. The fallout from this scandal revealed a troubling truth: over 300,000 veterans have died while waiting for the care they desperately needed. This statistic underscores a grim reality for many who have served in the armed forces, prompting questions about the government’s commitment to their well-being.

Adding to the urgency of the situation, the issue of veteran suicides has become increasingly prevalent, with many taking their own lives while awaiting care from the VA. The emotional toll of these tragedies has not gone unnoticed, as families and advocates continue to push for reforms to ensure that veterans receive the support they deserve.

The stark contrast between the care afforded to a terrorist and that of veterans has raised eyebrows and sparked outrage among the public. Many are left wondering how the government can prioritize medical treatment for someone who has committed heinous acts over those who have defended the nation. This disparity highlights a critical need for change within the healthcare system, particularly in how it treats those who have served in uniform.

As the debate continues, the frustration surrounding the government's priorities remains palpable. The juxtaposition of a terrorist receiving premium medical attention while veterans languish in wait is a poignant reminder of the challenges that lie ahead in reforming the VA and ensuring that those who have sacrificed for their country are not left behind. The call for action grows louder, as citizens demand a system that honors and supports its veterans, rather than one that seemingly prioritizes the care of a convicted terrorist.",13.0,-18.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,473.0,-1.0588235294117647,-0.03805496828752643

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",http://freedomdaily.com/despicable-hillary-wants-put-hero-cop-stopped-mall-terror-attack-business/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-vs-cop.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a dramatic turn of events, Jason Falconer, a dedicated NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, intervened during a violent stabbing spree in St. Cloud, Minnesota, saving lives by shooting an ISIS terrorist who had already injured eight individuals. Falconer’s decisive actions have been hailed as heroic, emphasizing the critical role that trained citizens can play in emergency situations. 

Falconer operates Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., a business focused on instructing law-abiding citizens in concealed carry training for self-defense. His commitment to empowering individuals with the skills necessary to protect themselves and others is a testament to his dedication to public safety. However, this dedication is now at the center of a political storm, as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has publicly targeted Falconer’s business as part of her campaign platform should she be elected president.

Clinton’s plan includes a controversial proposal to eliminate the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), legislation that provides legal protections for firearms businesses against frivolous lawsuits. Critics argue that this legislative move would not only threaten the viability of businesses like Falconer’s but also infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of American citizens. Clinton has claimed that the PLCAA offers immunity to gun manufacturers and dealers, a characterization that has been widely disputed. 

Supporters of the PLCAA argue that it is essential for protecting responsible businesses from being held liable for the criminal actions of individuals who misuse firearms. The law was enacted to prevent the erosion of the firearms industry through an onslaught of lawsuits that could cripple manufacturers and retailers. Falconer, who has dedicated his life to law enforcement and firearms training, stands as a prime example of how responsible gun ownership and training can contribute positively to community safety.

The implications of Clinton’s proposed policies extend beyond the immediate impact on firearms businesses. Advocates for gun rights warn that such measures could create a chilling effect on the ability of citizens to exercise their Second Amendment rights. Falconer’s experience and actions during the St. Cloud incident underscore the importance of firearms training and the potential consequences of disarming law-abiding citizens. 

Clinton’s focus on targeting firearm businesses has raised concerns among many who believe that her approach could lead to unintended consequences, particularly for those who rely on firearms for personal protection and self-defense. The narrative surrounding Falconer’s heroic actions serves as a poignant reminder of the critical role that responsible gun owners play in safeguarding their communities. 

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the debate surrounding gun rights and the regulation of firearms remains heated. Falconer’s situation exemplifies the broader conflict between those advocating for stricter gun control measures and those fighting to uphold the rights enshrined in the Second Amendment. The outcome of this debate will undoubtedly shape the future of firearms legislation and the rights of citizens across the nation.

In conclusion, Jason Falconer’s heroic intervention during the St. Cloud stabbing incident has not only saved lives but has also ignited a significant political discourse regarding firearm rights and the future of businesses like Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. With Clinton’s proposed policies threatening to undermine the legal protections afforded to firearms businesses, the stakes have never been higher for advocates of the Second Amendment. As the nation grapples with these critical issues, the actions and experiences of individuals like Falconer will continue to resonate in the ongoing conversation about gun rights and public safety.",-11.0,14.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,655.0,0.56,0.021374045801526718
Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the presidential election heats up, Hillary Clinton's health has emerged as a pivotal topic, dominating headlines and influencing voter perceptions. Recent polling data underscores the significance of this issue, revealing that over 40% of registered voters now view Clinton's health as ""below average"" or ""very poor."" This marks a striking increase from just 26% in late August, highlighting a growing unease among the electorate regarding the former Secretary of State's fitness for office.

In contrast, the percentage of voters who consider Clinton's health to be ""average"" has remained steady at 28%. Meanwhile, her opponent, Donald Trump, has seen a slight uptick in the number of voters who perceive his health as ""above average"" or ""excellent,"" rising from 33% to 36%. This shift in public opinion could have significant implications as both candidates vie for support in a highly competitive race.

The growing concern about Clinton's health is not just limited to polling numbers. Almost 80% of respondents in a recent survey expressed awareness of her potential medical issues, suggesting that health perceptions are deeply ingrained in the public consciousness. At 68 years old, Clinton is perceived to look older than her age, which has further fueled suspicions and speculation about her overall well-being.

Reports indicating that Clinton is taking Coumadin, a blood thinner, have raised eyebrows, particularly as it is often associated with serious health conditions. Additionally, her reported research into Provigil, a medication linked to conditions such as narcolepsy and other serious illnesses, has intensified scrutiny over her health status. Anecdotal evidence from her assistant, Huma Abedin, has suggested that Clinton experiences episodes of confusion and requires frequent naps, which only adds to the narrative of a candidate struggling with health issues.

The public's concern has been exacerbated by various videos and photos that depict Clinton in compromising situations. Instances where she appears to pass out, stumble, or require assistance have been widely circulated, leading to heightened scrutiny of her health. Notably, one such incident occurred during a ceremony at the 9/11 Memorial, where Clinton appeared to faint. Claims have emerged that videos documenting these health incidents are being systematically removed from the internet, raising questions about transparency and the campaign's handling of health-related concerns.

Adding to the narrative, observations from Clinton's campaign events suggest a decline in attendance, which some speculate may be a strategic move to minimize public scrutiny of her health. This trend has led to further speculation about whether her campaign is attempting to shield her from the spotlight due to ongoing health concerns.

Moreover, Clinton's frequent coughing during speeches has become a focal point of public obsession and concern. The repeated episodes have led to questions about her fitness for the presidency, as voters weigh the implications of a candidate's health on their ability to fulfill the demanding role of the nation's leader.

As the election approaches, the implications of these health-related concerns could be profound. Voter perceptions of a candidate's health can significantly influence their decision at the ballot box, and for Clinton, the increasing skepticism surrounding her well-being poses a formidable challenge. The narrative surrounding her health may continue to evolve as the campaign progresses, with both supporters and critics closely monitoring developments.

In conclusion, Hillary Clinton's health has become a critical issue in the current presidential election, with significant polling implications and widespread public concern. As voters grapple with the implications of her health on her candidacy, the campaign will need to navigate this sensitive topic carefully. With the election drawing nearer, Clinton's health will likely remain a central point of discussion, shaping the dynamics of the race and influencing voter sentiment in the months to come.",-11.0,14.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,719.0,0.5384615384615384,0.019471488178025034

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

Dolly Kyle, a former friend of Bill Clinton, has stirred controversy with the release of her tell-all book titled ""Hillary: The Other Woman."" The book presents a series of provocative claims about both Bill and Hillary Clinton, focusing particularly on Hillary's perceived elitism and her attitudes toward those she deems beneath her.

In the book, Kyle paints a picture of Hillary Clinton as someone who looks down on the residents of Arkansas, describing them as ""ignorant hillbillies."" This perception is particularly striking given Hillary's own roots in a middle-class suburb of Illinois. Kyle recounts a revealing incident during an Easter egg hunt, where Hillary allegedly expressed frustration regarding developmentally challenged children, further illustrating her purported disdain for certain groups.

The narrative also delves into the time the Clintons spent in the Arkansas governor's mansion, where both Bill and Hillary reportedly grew weary of the state's routine and lifestyle. This dissatisfaction appears to have influenced Bill Clinton's political decisions, as he ultimately chose not to run for reelection in 1990, setting his sights instead on a presidential bid.

Kyle's revelations have reignited discussions about the Clinton legacy and the dynamics of their relationship, as well as Hillary's public persona. The book's claims, particularly those regarding her attitudes toward Arkansas residents and her expressions of frustration, have drawn sharp criticism and raised questions about her character.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, ""Hillary: The Other Woman"" offers a controversial perspective that challenges the public's perception of Hillary Clinton, providing a glimpse into the private thoughts and experiences of those who have known her intimately. The implications of Kyle's claims may resonate in the ongoing discourse surrounding the Clintons and their impact on American politics.",-10.0,-16.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,342.0,-1.4545454545454546,-0.04678362573099415

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a groundbreaking and contentious decision, a Massachusetts judge has ruled in favor of a special law that directly impacts black males. This ruling, which is now in effect, has sparked heated debates regarding its implications for public safety throughout the state. The law, which allows individuals who feel ""disproportionately"" targeted by law enforcement to flee from police without facing legal consequences, has raised eyebrows among various stakeholders.

The ruling comes at a time when tensions between law enforcement and minority communities remain high. Observers suggest that the decision may be influenced by the fear that some black Americans experience when interacting with police officers. This fear often leads to a tendency to flee, a behavior that the new law now legitimizes. Critics argue that this development could exacerbate existing tensions and complicate the already challenging relationship between police and the communities they serve.

Under the previous legal framework, fleeing from a police officer could be interpreted as ""reasonable suspicion,"" providing law enforcement with the authority to detain individuals. However, with the new ruling in place, this precedent has been overturned, raising concerns among law enforcement officials about their ability to effectively carry out their duties. The implications of this change are significant, as police officers face considerable dangers in their line of work—dangers that many civilians may not fully grasp.

Supporters of the law argue that it is a necessary measure to protect individuals who feel unfairly targeted by police. They contend that the legislation acknowledges the deep-rooted issues of systemic racism and the need for reform in policing practices. However, detractors maintain that the law undermines the fundamental ability of police to protect and serve their communities effectively. They fear that it may embolden individuals to evade law enforcement, potentially leading to increased crime and diminished public safety.

The ruling has elicited a range of reactions from community leaders, law enforcement agencies, and civil rights organizations. Some community advocates hail the decision as a step towards addressing the historical injustices faced by black Americans, while police unions and officials express grave concerns about the potential consequences for public safety and officer welfare.

As the law takes effect, its real-world implications remain to be seen. Law enforcement agencies are grappling with how to adapt to this new legal landscape while ensuring the safety of all citizens. The controversy surrounding the ruling underscores the complexities of balancing civil rights with public safety, a challenge that continues to resonate within Massachusetts and beyond.

In the coming weeks, community discussions and debates are expected to intensify as stakeholders seek to navigate the ramifications of this unprecedented ruling. The discourse surrounding the law will likely shape the future of policing in Massachusetts, as well as the ongoing dialogue about race, justice, and public safety in America.",-13.0,2.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,526.0,0.09523809523809523,0.0038022813688212928
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

In his remarks, Sansaricq criticized the response to the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, asserting that corruption significantly hindered the delivery of essential aid to those in need.

Sansaricq alleged that the Clintons exploited the disaster for personal gain, misappropriating billions of dollars that were intended for Haitian relief efforts. He emphasized that while the Clintons have accrued significant wealth, many Haitians continue to suffer in impoverished conditions. His call for transparency regarding the allocation of funds raised questions about the effectiveness of aid delivery in the aftermath of the earthquake.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid admission, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has acknowledged that she would alter her open migrant policy if given the chance to revisit the past. This reflection comes in the wake of the Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) disappointing performance in recent elections held in Berlin, which have been attributed to a growing wave of anti-migrant sentiment across the nation.

Merkel's comments indicate a willingness to explore a new direction in policy regarding refugees, signaling a potential shift in her long-standing approach. The chancellor openly recognized her unpreparedness for the 2015 refugee crisis, a pivotal moment that saw a significant influx of asylum seekers into Germany. She took responsibility for the CDU's poor election results, which many analysts believe are linked to rising concerns about migration and the emergence of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

The election outcomes have highlighted a troubling trend in public opinion, where anti-migrant sentiments have intensified. This shift has been exacerbated by fears surrounding terrorism and crime that some associate with the influx of refugees. Merkel's reflections come at a critical time, as the CDU grapples with the implications of these sentiments on its electoral prospects, particularly with the federal elections on the horizon.

Despite her regrets about the past, Merkel has firmly rejected the idea of implementing significant policy changes at this juncture. Specifically, she dismissed proposals from her coalition partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), which called for a cap on the number of migrants allowed into the country and suggested prioritizing Christian migrants over Muslim asylum seekers. Merkel emphasized that such discriminatory measures would contradict the core principles of her party and the fundamental values of Germany itself.

The chancellor's stance has not been without controversy. In 2017, CSU leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw his party's support for Merkel due to her approach to migration, underscoring the tensions within her coalition. These internal disputes have raised questions about her leadership and the stability of her government as the political landscape in Germany continues to evolve.

As the CDU faces mounting challenges, analysts suggest that Merkel's policies may hinder her party's performance in the upcoming federal election. The growing influence of the AfD, which has capitalized on fears surrounding immigration, poses a significant threat to the traditional political order in Germany. With Merkel's legacy on the line, her ability to navigate the complex landscape of public opinion regarding migration will be crucial in determining the future of her party.

In summary, Merkel's recent admissions reveal a leader grappling with the consequences of her decisions during a tumultuous period in Germany's history. While she remains committed to the principles of inclusivity and non-discrimination, the pressures of electoral politics and shifting public sentiment present formidable challenges. As the CDU prepares for the upcoming elections, the question remains: can Merkel reconcile her ideals with the realities of a changing political climate?",-14.0,-16.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,549.0,-0.8,-0.029143897996357013
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

In Sundsvall, Sweden, a troubling incident involving Abdullah, a 35-year-old Muslim Somali asylum seeker, has come to light, raising serious concerns about domestic violence and the interpretation of religious texts. Abdullah, who has multiple convictions for violent crimes, including assaults and molestations, has been living off welfare benefits since arriving in Sweden five years ago.

The incident occurred after Abdullah returned home from a night of partying to find his wife’s niece still at their residence. Despite having previously instructed her to leave, Abdullah's reaction was anything but measured. In a violent outburst, he physically assaulted his pregnant wife, kicking her in the head and stomach. This brutal attack not only endangered the health of his wife and unborn child but also highlighted a disturbing pattern of behavior that has plagued Abdullah's life since his arrival in Sweden.

The violence escalated further as Abdullah humiliated his wife by pouring beer on her and urinating on her. Such actions not only reflect a severe lack of respect and compassion but also raise questions about the underlying motivations driving Abdullah's behavior. The incident has sparked a broader conversation about the interpretations of Quranic teachings, particularly referencing Quran 4:34, which discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. This verse has often been cited by individuals seeking to justify abusive behavior, suggesting that it may provide a rationale for Abdullah’s violent actions.

However, the author of the article criticizes this selective adherence to religious teachings, emphasizing the contradictions inherent in Abdullah's behavior. While he may invoke religious texts to justify his actions, the reality of his conduct starkly contrasts with the core principles of compassion and respect that many religions espouse. The use of violence and humiliation against a partner undermines the very tenets of love and mutual respect that are foundational to marital relationships.

This incident not only highlights the personal failings of Abdullah but also raises broader societal questions about the responsibilities of individuals who seek refuge in new countries. Living on welfare benefits for five years without integrating into society or adhering to its norms poses challenges not only for the individual but also for the community at large. Abdullah's violent actions serve as a reminder of the urgent need for effective support systems that address the complexities of asylum seekers' lives, particularly those with a history of violence.

As the investigation into this incident continues, the community is left grappling with the implications of Abdullah's actions. The need for a more nuanced understanding of religious teachings, combined with a commitment to addressing domestic violence, is paramount. Society must work towards creating a culture that promotes healthy relationships and discourages any form of abuse, regardless of its justification. 

In conclusion, Abdullah's violent behavior and the subsequent humiliation of his wife underscore the critical importance of addressing domestic violence and the often problematic interpretations of religious texts that can perpetuate such acts. As discussions surrounding this incident unfold, it is essential to foster an environment that prioritizes compassion, understanding, and respect for all individuals.",-28.0,-47.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,572.0,-2.238095238095238,-0.08216783216783216
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has sparked significant controversy, Pennsylvania Republicans are advocating for House Bill 29, a legislative proposal that would enable non-residents to monitor polling places and challenge voters on Election Day. This bill, first introduced in June, is seen by critics as a direct attempt to facilitate voter intimidation, particularly in support of former President Donald Trump.

The proposed legislation would allow individuals who do not reside in Pennsylvania to engage in activities that could disrupt the voting process. Critics, including Adam Gitlin, counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, have raised alarms about the potential ramifications of such a bill. Gitlin argues that the measure could lead to discriminatory challenges based on voters' race or religion, ultimately creating longer lines at polling places and discouraging participation in the electoral process.

There is a growing concern that conservative supporters of Trump may specifically target marginalized communities, including Black, Latino, and Muslim voters, with these challenges. This targeted approach raises questions about the integrity of the voting process and the rights of individuals to cast their votes without fear of intimidation.

The backdrop for this legislative push is Trump's ongoing rhetoric surrounding the electoral process. The former president has frequently claimed that the upcoming election could be rigged against him, urging his supporters to take an active role in monitoring polling areas. This call to action has only intensified fears that House Bill 29 could serve as a vehicle for voter intimidation tactics, particularly in a closely contested election.

In a further twist, an amendment to the bill has been proposed that would allow it to take effect immediately upon being signed by the governor, bypassing the usual waiting period of 60 days. This urgency underscores the Republican Party's commitment to advancing the bill before the election, raising concerns about the potential for widespread voter intimidation tactics to be employed in the state.

As the election approaches, the implications of House Bill 29 extend beyond Pennsylvania. If successful, the bill could set a precedent that might lead to the legalization of similar voter intimidation tactics across the country. This prospect has alarmed voting rights advocates who fear that such measures could undermine the democratic process and disenfranchise vulnerable populations.

The potential impact of voter intimidation on down-ballot races is another critical consideration. With the election expected to be closely contested, the ability to challenge voters could disproportionately benefit Trump and his supporters, potentially skewing the results in favor of Republican candidates.

As the debate over House Bill 29 continues, the stakes are high for both voters and lawmakers. The bill's proponents argue that it is necessary to ensure election integrity, while critics contend that it is a thinly veiled attempt to suppress voter turnout among specific demographic groups. The outcome of this legislative battle could have lasting consequences for the electoral landscape in Pennsylvania and beyond.

In conclusion, as Pennsylvania Republicans push forward with House Bill 29, the implications of this legislation are far-reaching. The potential for voter intimidation on Election Day raises serious concerns about the integrity of the electoral process, particularly in a political climate that has seen heightened tensions surrounding voting rights. With the election fast approaching, the eyes of the nation remain on Pennsylvania as this contentious bill moves through the legislative process.",-19.0,-13.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,618.0,-0.5652173913043478,-0.021035598705501618

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

[I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, a trailblazing American Olympian fencer, has garnered attention for being the first American to compete in the Olympics while wearing a Hijab. Her historic achievement has not shielded her from feelings of insecurity and fear, as she recently shared her experiences of being followed home from practice. These incidents have raised alarms about the pervasive issues of racism and safety that many individuals face in the United States.

In her statements, Muhammad highlighted serious incidents of violence and discrimination that resonate not only with her personal experiences but also with the broader challenges faced by the Muslim community. Her candid reflections shed light on the ongoing struggles against prejudice and the emotional toll it takes on those who endure such treatment.

While Muhammad's concerns about the state of America are significant, the article also points out a contrasting reality: there are more reported hate crimes against Jewish individuals than against Muslims in the U.S. This statistic prompts a deeper examination of the complexities surrounding discrimination and the varying experiences of different communities.

The article raises a provocative question regarding Muhammad's choice to remain in the United States despite her grievances. It suggests that she might consider relocating to a Muslim-majority country, where conditions for Muslims could be perceived as more favorable. This line of questioning invites a broader discussion about the nuances of safety, belonging, and the experiences of Muslims living in diverse societies.

Furthermore, the author argues that Muhammad's grievances, while valid, may seem minor when juxtaposed with the potential dangers that could be faced in a Muslim-majority country. This perspective challenges the narrative of victimhood and invites a more comprehensive dialogue about the realities of life for Muslims both in America and abroad.

As Ibtihaj Muhammad continues to navigate her journey as a pioneering athlete, her experiences serve as a reminder of the ongoing conversations about race, identity, and safety in the modern world.",-23.0,-8.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,362.0,-0.6153846153846154,-0.022099447513812154
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

In recent days, the city of Charlotte has witnessed a troubling escalation of protests that have devolved into riots, ignited by a police shooting involving a black officer and a black suspect. What began as a demonstration has quickly transformed into a scene of chaos, drawing sharp criticism for the behavior exhibited by many of those involved.

The actions of the protesters have been nothing short of disgraceful, with numerous instances highlighting a troubling trend of mockery and violence. Reports have emerged of protesters openly mocking an injured police officer, demonstrating a complete disregard for the gravity of the situation and the sacrifices made by law enforcement. This behavior not only undermines the message they claim to support but also reveals a disturbing lack of empathy for the consequences of their actions.

The unrest has spiraled into violence, with many protesters engaging in destructive behavior that further exacerbates the situation. The term ""idiots"" seems too mild to describe those who have taken to the streets with the intent to incite chaos rather than promote constructive dialogue. Instead of fostering understanding, these individuals have chosen to perpetuate a cycle of violence that only serves to deepen the divide within the community.

Moreover, there is a glaring lack of accountability among the protesters. Many seem to believe they can act with impunity, contributing to societal issues without facing the repercussions of their actions. This avoidance of responsibility is not only troubling but also indicative of a broader problem within the movement. It raises questions about the sincerity of their intentions and whether they genuinely seek to address the issues they claim to care about.

The Black Lives Matter movement, which has been a focal point of these protests, has come under scrutiny for its perceived hypocrisy. While the movement advocates for accountability in police actions, it appears to turn a blind eye to the violence that occurs within the community itself. This contradiction is hard to overlook and raises critical questions about the true motivations behind the protests. How can one demand justice from law enforcement while simultaneously ignoring the violence that plagues their own neighborhoods?

Critics of the movement have pointed out that many supporters seem to embody a troubling blend of characteristics that can be generalized as violent and uneducated. This stereotype, while unfortunate, is reinforced by the actions witnessed during the protests. It is essential to recognize that the behaviors exhibited by some protesters do not reflect the values of an entire community, yet they cast a long shadow over the movement as a whole.

The conclusion drawn from these events is a strong condemnation of both the behavior exhibited during the protests and the movement that has become synonymous with the unrest. It is crucial to judge individuals based on their actions rather than their skin color; however, the actions of many protesters have painted a disheartening picture. The focus should be on fostering constructive dialogue and seeking solutions, rather than resorting to violence and mockery.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of these protests, it is imperative for community leaders and activists to reflect on the message they wish to convey. The path forward must involve accountability, understanding, and a commitment to addressing the root causes of the issues at hand. Only through genuine dialogue and responsible action can the community hope to heal and move towards a more equitable future. 

In summary, the recent riots in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the challenges that lie ahead. While the desire for justice is understandable, it must not come at the cost of community cohesion and respect for one another. The path forward requires introspection and a willingness to engage in meaningful conversations that promote healing rather than division.",-83.0,-72.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,692.0,-2.5714285714285716,-0.10404624277456648
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In a charged atmosphere at the United Nations General Assembly, President Obama delivered his final speech, underscoring his vision for international governance and law. Characterized by many as a far-left, borderline socialist progressive liberal, Obama's policies have faced intense scrutiny throughout his presidency. Critics have labeled initiatives such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and refugee acceptance as ""ridiculous,"" reflecting a growing frustration among some Americans.

During his address, Obama made a controversial assertion that the United States may need to sacrifice certain freedoms in the name of global security. This stance has sparked further debate, particularly regarding the balance between national interests and international cooperation. However, the president was clear on one point: the right to defend oneself should remain sacrosanct. 

Despite acknowledging the backlash from Americans regarding his perspectives, Obama maintained his commitment to his beliefs, demonstrating a steadfastness that some interpret as arrogance. This unwavering attitude has contributed to a sense of division in Washington D.C., where cooperation among representatives seems increasingly elusive. 

The frustrations surrounding Obama's approach reflect a broader discontent with the current political climate. Many observers question the feasibility of fostering collaboration in a landscape marked by stark ideological divides. As Obama prepares to conclude his presidency, his final address at the UN encapsulates the tensions that have characterized his time in office, leaving many to ponder the implications of his vision for the future.

As the nation stands at a crossroads, the challenges of governance—both domestic and international—remain pressing. The question looms: can a compromise be reached in a polarized environment, or will the divisions deepen as leaders grapple with the complexities of modern governance? Obama's legacy, particularly in light of his final speech, will undoubtedly continue to provoke discussion and debate in the years to come.",13.0,2.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,352.0,0.14285714285714285,0.005681818181818182
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the landscape of professional football, two names frequently evoke strong reactions: Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick. Both athletes, once celebrated for their skills as quarterbacks, now find themselves sidelined in the NFL, but their public personas and the narratives surrounding them could not be more different. 

Tim Tebow, known for his devout Christian faith and positive demeanor, has carved out a reputation as a respectable figure in sports. His approach to life and career has consistently emphasized integrity and hard work. In contrast, Colin Kaepernick has become a polarizing figure, primarily due to his National Anthem protest, which many perceive as a sign of disrespect. This juxtaposition raises questions about how athletes are viewed based on their actions and beliefs.

Recently, Tebow briefly addressed Kaepernick's protest, highlighting the importance of standing for one's beliefs ""the right way."" This comment underscores Tebow's commitment to expressing his views while maintaining a sense of respect for the traditions of the game and the country. His stance is a reflection of his character, as he has largely avoided negative press and remained focused on his career, which currently includes his pursuit of success with the New York Mets.

On the other hand, Kaepernick's decision to kneel during the National Anthem has drawn significant criticism. The author of this article suggests that Kaepernick, now a high-paid bench player, should consider using his time more wisely and protest on his own time rather than during a national sporting event. This sentiment encapsulates the frustration felt by many who believe that Kaepernick's actions have overshadowed his athletic achievements.

Moreover, the article presents a controversial perspective on the concept of oppression in the United States. The author asserts that no one in the U.S. is truly oppressed and views claims of oppression as mere excuses for laziness. This claim is bolstered by a reference to Barack Obama’s presidency, which the author argues serves as evidence against the notion of systemic oppression in contemporary America.

As the discussion unfolds, the contrast between Tebow and Kaepernick becomes even more pronounced. While Tebow is celebrated for his work ethic and positive contributions, Kaepernick's legacy is marred by the divisive nature of his protest. The author expresses hope for Tebow's success with the Mets, wishing him well as he continues to pursue his dreams in a new arena.

In conclusion, the diverging paths of Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick serve as a reflection of broader societal attitudes towards respect, protest, and the responsibilities of public figures. As both athletes navigate their careers away from the NFL, their stories continue to spark debate and provoke thought about the role of sports in social discourse.",-6.0,4.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,515.0,0.2,0.007766990291262136
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

As discussions surrounding national security intensify, the importance of a robust border wall has emerged as a critical topic. Advocates argue that the wall is not merely a tool to deter illegal immigration, but a necessary measure to safeguard the nation against various threats, including terrorism and drug trafficking.

Historically, the construction of barriers for protection is not a novel concept. The Great Wall of China, for instance, was erected to fend off foreign invaders, highlighting a long-standing recognition of the need to protect national sovereignty. This historical precedent is being referenced in the context of the United States, where concerns about the unsecured Southern Border have become increasingly pronounced.

The situation in Mexico, particularly the influence of powerful drug cartels, has raised alarms. Reports indicate that these cartels not only control vast territories but also contribute to a staggering death toll that some compare to the violence perpetrated by ISIS. The potential for these groups to exploit vulnerabilities in border security poses a significant risk, with fears that the Southern Border could serve as an entry point for terrorist organizations.

Recent developments have heightened these security concerns. Federal agents reported the interception of eight Syrian nationals attempting to illegally enter the U.S. from Mexico. This incident, occurring at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, has raised eyebrows, particularly in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, which underscored the persistent threat of international terrorism.

Hector Garza, President of the National Border Patrol Council, has acknowledged the reports regarding the Syrian nationals crossing the border. While he refrains from confirming specific details for security reasons, he emphasizes the urgency of addressing border security. Garza has been vocal about the limitations imposed on Border Patrol operations during the Obama administration, which he believes have hampered their effectiveness in managing border security.

Furthermore, Garza pointed out a troubling statistic: approximately 80% of individuals apprehended while illegally entering the U.S. are not deported and are allowed to remain in the country. This statistic underscores the challenges faced by law enforcement in maintaining secure borders.

In light of these issues, Garza and other advocates are calling for stronger border security measures and are urging support for presidential candidates who prioritize these concerns. As the debate continues, the need for a comprehensive approach to border security remains a pressing matter for national safety and sovereignty.",-13.0,-11.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,447.0,-0.6111111111111112,-0.024608501118568233

These people LOVED Trump. They cheered for him, he sat quietly as they told their stories.

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

The camera followed them out of the room, scurrying like the rats they are.

Their positive sentiments stood in stark contrast to the media's portrayal of Trump, which some attendees felt was unjustly negative.

Interestingly, the media left the event before the audience could voice their complaints about the Clintons, particularly highlighting their perceived neglect of Haiti. Audience members accused the Clintons of mishandling funds intended for aid, alleging that much of the financial assistance did not reach those in need but instead benefited Washington lobbyists and the White House. This sentiment resonated strongly among the attendees, who felt that the promised aid had failed to materialize for the Haitian people.

Furthermore, the audience criticized former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her role in blocking an increase in Haiti's daily minimum wage from $3 to $5. This decision was seen as detrimental to the economic welfare of many Haitians, further fueling their discontent with the Clintons.

The media's early departure from the event raised eyebrows, with some speculating that it stemmed from a lack of negative coverage regarding Trump and the overwhelmingly favorable view of him held by the audience. As the event concluded, the voices of the Haitian attendees highlighted a complex narrative often overlooked in mainstream media discussions.

Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a bold and controversial move, former President Donald Trump has proposed a ban on Muslim immigration until a better understanding of terrorism can be achieved. This proposal has ignited a fierce debate, particularly among Democrats, who have labeled it as racist. However, some argue that racism pertains specifically to race rather than religion, suggesting that the discourse surrounding Trump's proposal may be mischaracterized.

The article posits that Islam, as a religion, is prone to radicalization, citing extremist actions perpetrated by a small faction of its followers. This perspective raises questions about the implications of immigration policies in relation to national security and public safety. As discussions around this issue intensify, a recent poll in Australia has revealed a significant shift in public opinion regarding Muslim immigration.

According to the latest Essential Research survey, 49% of Australians now support a ban on Muslim immigration, a notable increase from just 28% the previous October. This dramatic rise in support indicates a growing concern among the Australian populace regarding the potential risks associated with Muslim migration. The survey also highlighted that 48% of voters are in favor of initiating a national debate on the subject, suggesting that the issue is gaining traction in political discourse.

The poll results further reveal that two-thirds of Australians believe populist senator Pauline Hanson addresses topics that others tend to avoid. This sentiment may reflect a broader frustration with political correctness and an eagerness to confront uncomfortable truths about immigration and its implications for society.

Support for a ban on Muslim immigration is driven by various factors, with fears of terrorism and concerns about the integration of Muslim migrants into Australian society being the primary motivators. The poll indicates that support for such a ban spans across different political affiliations, with 60% of Coalition supporters, 40% of Labour voters, and 34% of Green voters backing the proposal. This cross-party support suggests that the concerns surrounding Muslim immigration are not confined to a single political ideology, but rather resonate with a significant portion of the electorate.

The pollster expressed surprise at the substantial backing for the ban, indicating that it reflects broader societal views rather than being representative of a marginalized group. This revelation underscores the importance of acknowledging and addressing the concerns of the public in discussions about immigration policy.

In light of these developments, the article critiques the approach taken by political figures such as Hillary Clinton, who may dismiss dissenting opinions rather than engage with them constructively. It suggests that recognizing and addressing opposing views could lead to more effective dialogue and a better understanding of the complexities surrounding immigration and national security.

As the debate continues, the implications of Trump's immigration proposal and the rising support for similar measures in Australia highlight a growing unease about the intersection of immigration, religion, and security. The call for a national debate on the issue may provide a platform for citizens to voice their concerns and for policymakers to navigate the challenging terrain of immigration in a way that prioritizes both safety and inclusivity.

In conclusion, the evolving discourse around Muslim immigration, both in the United States and Australia, reflects a significant shift in public sentiment. As fears of terrorism and integration challenges take center stage, it remains to be seen how political leaders will respond to the demands for a more nuanced and comprehensive discussion on these pressing issues.",2.0,20.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,637.0,0.9090909090909091,0.03139717425431711

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",http://freedomdaily.com/white-men-set-on-fire-by-blacks-media-censored/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/whites-on-fire.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a shocking turn of events, a recent street fight has drawn significant attention after a video surfaced, depicting a chaotic scene that escalated dramatically. The footage reveals a group of individuals embroiled in a physical altercation when an unexpected and horrifying act occurs: one of the participants is set on fire.

The author of the article covering this incident has come forward to dispute claims made by Buzzfeed, which asserted that the description of the crime and the victims involved was inaccurate. The author stands firmly by their account, emphasizing the gravity of the situation as it unfolded in real-time. 

As the video rolls on, it captures the pandemonium of the street fight, with victims running in a desperate attempt to escape the flames and avoid being struck by oncoming vehicles. The chaotic atmosphere raises serious concerns about public safety and the mindset of those involved. The use of a Molotov cocktail in this scenario has sparked questions about premeditated intent, suggesting that the individual responsible had a calculated plan to escalate the violence.

The author expresses profound shock and disgust at the act of igniting individuals, highlighting the disturbing nature of such behavior. The imagery of people engulfed in flames serves as a stark reminder of the potential for violence that lurks beneath the surface of societal interactions. 

In reflecting on this incident, the author laments the changing norms of societal behavior. There is a growing trend where bystanders choose to film rather than intervene in dangerous situations. This shift in mindset raises questions about personal responsibility and the collective duty to ensure the safety of others. The author nostalgically recalls a time when community members would step in to de-escalate conflicts, prioritizing the well-being of those involved rather than capturing the spectacle for social media.

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The need for a border wall is emphasized for both preventing illegal immigration and securing access points into America.

Luna County, New Mexico, is on high alert following a routine traffic stop that involved an undocumented Middle Eastern woman, raising significant concerns about border security and potential terror threats. The incident has reignited discussions about the necessity of a border wall, emphasizing its role in preventing illegal immigration and securing access points into the United States.

The unidentified woman, described as an ""Islamic refugee,"" reportedly had plans for a gas pipeline located near Deming, New Mexico. Her intentions remain unclear, leading to fears regarding possible future attacks. The situation has prompted investigations by the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and U.S. Border Patrol. Fortunately, initial investigations have revealed no immediate threats; however, the discovery of the woman in a border county has raised alarms among local law enforcement and community members.

The gas pipeline in question is situated in a remote area, suggesting that the woman may have been scouting for targets rather than planning an immediate attack. This has led to heightened scrutiny of the potential risks posed by undocumented individuals crossing the southern border. Concerns are particularly pronounced regarding the presence of undocumented Muslim individuals, as they could pose unique challenges to national security.

Historical context adds to these worries. A 2015 report from Judicial Watch indicated a troubling collaboration between Mexican cartels and terror organizations, which has facilitated the smuggling of individuals from dangerous countries into the United States. Additionally, a 2017 report highlighted instances of Mexico-based Islamic terror groups crossing the border to scout targets, further complicating the security landscape.

In light of these developments, there are increasing calls for Congress to approve funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall. Advocates argue that a secure barrier is essential not only to prevent entry by terrorists but also to combat drug cartels that exploit vulnerabilities in border security. The argument is made that many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. are not from Mexico and may receive support from the Mexican government, underscoring the need for a comprehensive approach to border security.

The recent incident in Luna County serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by law enforcement and national security agencies. As concerns about potential terrorist infiltration persist, the debate over the necessity of a border wall continues to gain momentum, with advocates stressing that securing the southern border is critical to protecting the nation from foreign threats.",-44.0,-37.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,452.0,-2.176470588235294,-0.08185840707964602

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In the world of professional sports, where victories and losses often define an athlete's legacy, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands out by prioritizing faith in God, family, and friends above all else. Wilson's perspective on life and football transcends the confines of the gridiron, as he aims to inspire others to find joy and peace through the power of good choices and unwavering faith.

Wilson’s journey is not just about throwing touchdowns; it’s about sharing a message of hope that resonates deeply with many. He believes that actions speak louder than words, especially in light of the NFL's advisory against discussing personal faith publicly. This guidance has not deterred Wilson; instead, it has reinforced his resolve to embody his beliefs through his conduct both on and off the field.

In Wilson's view, the hierarchy of priorities is critical for personal success and stress reduction. He emphasizes that faith, family, and football should be kept in that specific order. This approach not only shapes his identity as an athlete but also as a person committed to making a positive impact in the lives of others. By sharing his life philosophy, Wilson hopes to encourage fans and fellow athletes alike to focus on what truly matters, fostering a sense of community and support.

However, the article critiques the broader societal attitudes towards faith and patriotism, shedding light on a perceived hypocrisy in what is deemed acceptable to discuss publicly. In a culture that often champions freedom of expression, the reluctance to embrace conversations about faith raises questions about the values upheld by society. The double standard becomes apparent when one considers how openly discussing patriotism is often celebrated, while faith can be met with skepticism or disapproval.

This critique extends into the realm of leadership, where concerns about corruption and deception loom large, particularly in the current political climate. Wilson’s commitment to integrity and service stands in stark contrast to the actions of some leaders, prompting a reflection on the qualities we seek in those who guide us. The juxtaposition of Wilson’s values against the backdrop of political disarray highlights a yearning for authenticity and righteousness in leadership.

Moreover, the article questions the societal perception of serving others and promoting happiness. In a world where self-interest often trumps altruism, Wilson’s focus on uplifting others through his platform raises eyebrows. Why is it that efforts to encourage joy and peace can be viewed negatively in certain contexts? This inquiry invites readers to reconsider their own beliefs about service and the importance of prioritizing the well-being of others.

As Wilson navigates the complexities of fame and professional sports, he remains steadfast in his commitment to standing for truth and righteousness. His journey serves as a reminder that amidst societal challenges, there is a profound need for individuals to uphold their values and share their light with the world. 

In conclusion, Russell Wilson's approach to life and football is a testament to the power of faith, family, and integrity. By prioritizing these elements, he not only seeks personal fulfillment but also aims to inspire a broader movement towards positivity and hope. As he continues to engage with fans and fellow athletes, Wilson’s message is clear: in a world filled with distractions and challenges, it is essential to remain anchored in one’s beliefs and to promote a culture of kindness and service.",79.0,85.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,650.0,3.5416666666666665,0.13076923076923078
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a recent address to Italy's press, Pope Francis voiced strong criticism against fear-based media, equating it to a form of ""terrorism."" The Pope's remarks shed light on the detrimental effects of journalism that relies on gossip or rumors, emphasizing that such practices can inflict harm not only on individuals but also on society as a whole.

During his speech, Pope Francis underscored the significant power that journalists wield. He described their voices as a weapon capable of spreading fear among the public. This warning comes at a time when the media landscape is increasingly characterized by sensationalism and alarmism, raising concerns about the ethical responsibilities of journalists in shaping public perception.

The Pope's comments resonate deeply within the context of Italy's current issues with nationalism, as he acknowledged the challenges that arise when media stokes fears related to national identity and security. His observations are particularly relevant in the broader discussion about how media influences political climates, especially in countries like the United States.

In the U.S., the influence of certain media outlets, particularly Fox News, has been scrutinized for its role in fostering a climate of fear surrounding political figures such as Donald Trump. Despite a noted decrease in crime rates, many Americans report feeling increasingly anxious about terrorism and crime. Polls indicate that this heightened sense of fear is pervasive, affecting the way individuals perceive safety in their communities.

Moreover, concerns about mass shootings and civil unrest have surged in recent years, further contributing to a widespread sense of disorder and anxiety. The connection between media narratives and public sentiment is critical, as fear-mongering can distort reality and exacerbate societal tensions.

Fox News has emerged as a primary source of this fear-based narrative, often prioritizing sensational stories that evoke anxiety and concern. The network's approach has been linked to the broader political discourse, shaping perceptions and influencing voter behavior. As fear becomes a central theme in media coverage, it raises questions about the ethical implications of journalism and its impact on democracy.

Pope Francis' critique serves as a timely reminder of the responsibilities that come with the power of the press. By calling out fear-based reporting, he urges journalists to prioritize truth and integrity over sensationalism, advocating for a media landscape that fosters understanding rather than division. As society grapples with the complexities of modern communication, the Pope’s insights invite a reconsideration of how media narratives can either uplift or undermine the social fabric.",-56.0,-34.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,470.0,-1.8888888888888888,-0.07234042553191489
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We all must wait and

In a highly anticipated first general election debate, CNN polling has declared Hillary Clinton the winner, yet contrasting results from other outlets suggest that Donald Trump may be the preferred candidate among voters. The debate, which covered contentious topics such as the Birther movement, Clinton's email controversy, and Trump's tax returns, has sparked a flurry of reactions and analyses.

CNN's snap poll indicated that Clinton garnered 62% of the support, while Trump received only 27%. However, this result has raised questions about its credibility, particularly due to a sample pool that appeared to lean Democratic. Many observers are scrutinizing the implications of these findings, especially given that other snap polls from outlets like TIME Magazine, Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville have shown a preference for Trump among respondents.

Following the debate, Trump took to Twitter to express gratitude to his supporters for their favorable polling, while Clinton has yet to issue any comment on the matter. Despite Clinton's apparent lead in CNN's poll, it revealed mixed results regarding its potential influence on voter decisions moving forward.

Adding to the debate's drama, Trump alleged that the media had provided him with a defective microphone, which he claims hindered his performance. He also suggested that he should have brought up Bill Clinton's past infidelities during the discussion, indicating a strategic choice that may resonate with certain voter segments.

As the election date draws nearer, both candidates are acutely aware that time is running out to sway undecided voters. In a further twist, Julian Assange has hinted at an upcoming Wikileaks release that could have significant repercussions for Clinton's campaign, potentially adding another layer of complexity to an already charged political landscape.

With public opinion still in flux and the stakes higher than ever, the aftermath of the debate will likely continue to shape the narrative as both candidates strive for voter support in the critical weeks ahead.",18.0,11.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,387.0,0.9166666666666666,0.028423772609819122

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

Hillary Clinton is facing criticism for her premature declaration of victory following the recent presidential debate against Donald Trump. The former Secretary of State took to Twitter to announce her success, but her claim was met with swift backlash from social media users.

Focus group polls from both CNN and Fox News indicate that Clinton performed favorably during the debate. CNN's focus group, which comprised voters from Florida, reported an overwhelming score of 18-2 in favor of Clinton. Similarly, a group led by Fox News pollster Frank Luntz, consisting of Pennsylvania voters, showed a 16-6 score favoring Clinton as well. Despite these positive assessments, the debate's aftermath revealed a starkly different public sentiment.

Luntz highlighted Trump's struggles during the debate, particularly regarding his explanations on taxes. However, he noted a significant turnaround when Trump addressed the controversy surrounding Clinton's email scandal. This moment seemed to resonate with viewers, contributing to a more favorable view of Trump in that context.

In stark contrast to the CNN and Fox News findings, an alternative poll suggested a landslide victory for Trump, with a staggering 92% of respondents indicating he won the debate compared to just 8% for Clinton. This discrepancy in polling outcomes has sparked discussions about the varying perceptions of the debate.

Clinton's declaration of victory prompted a notable reaction on Twitter, where users quickly rallied against her assertion. The hashtag #TrumpWon began trending globally, reflecting a wave of sentiment that contradicted Clinton's claims. Critics took to the platform to voice their opinions, underscoring the complexities of public perception in the wake of political debates.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Clinton's early victory claim may linger in the minds of voters, influencing their opinions as the campaign season progresses. The debate has undoubtedly set the stage for a contentious race ahead, with both candidates facing unique challenges in winning over the electorate.",18.0,24.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,367.0,1.5,0.0653950953678474
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC - Protests erupted in Charlotte for a second consecutive night, ignited by the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. The protests, which began peacefully, rapidly escalated into chaos as tensions between demonstrators and law enforcement intensified.

The unrest took a tragic turn when a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured during the demonstrations. Initial reports from police indicated that the shooter was a civilian; however, numerous eyewitness accounts suggest otherwise, raising serious questions about the events that transpired.

Among the eyewitnesses was Todd Zimmer, who shared a graphic photograph of the scene and asserted that the city was lying about the incident. ""The truth is out there, and it’s not what they are saying,"" Zimmer stated emphatically. His comments echoed a growing sentiment among those present at the protest who felt that the narrative provided by law enforcement was misleading.

Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer and another eyewitness, took to social media to express his disbelief at the police's account of the shooting. ""I was there, I saw it happen, and it was not a civilian who fired that shot,"" Meyer tweeted, further fueling the outrage among protesters and supporters of Scott's family.

The protests began with chants of ""Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,"" a slogan that has become synonymous with movements against police violence, particularly within the African-American community. However, the atmosphere shifted dramatically when riot police arrived on the scene, leading to a clash between demonstrators and law enforcement.

Eyewitnesses reported that the sound of the gunfire was notably louder than what they would expect from a typical firearm, leading many to believe that the shots were fired by police officers. This belief was compounded by the swift deployment of tear gas by law enforcement on the retreating crowd of peaceful protesters, further escalating tensions and chaos in the streets of Charlotte.

In the wake of the shooting, the City of Charlotte quickly issued a statement claiming that the incident was a case of civilian-on-civilian violence. This assertion was met with skepticism from the public and those who witnessed the events unfold. Additional eyewitness accounts, including statements from Minister Steve Knight, contradicted the police narrative, suggesting that law enforcement was indeed responsible for the shooting.

Eddie Thomas, another eyewitness to the harrowing scene, recounted his experience, stating that he yelled for help from police officers who did not respond. ""It was a nightmare. I was screaming for them to help, but they just stood there,"" Thomas said, capturing the helplessness felt by many in the crowd as they watched the chaos unfold.

The protests in Charlotte are not an isolated incident but part of a larger pattern of state violence against African-Americans expressing their frustrations with systemic injustices. The killing of Kenneth L. Scott has reignited long-standing grievances regarding police conduct and accountability, particularly in communities of color.

As the situation in Charlotte continues to develop, the calls for justice and transparency grow louder. Demonstrators are demanding answers regarding the circumstances surrounding Scott's death and the shooting of the civilian. The community's frustration is palpable, as many feel that their voices are being dismissed by those in power.

The events in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle against police violence and the urgent need for reform. As protests continue, the spotlight remains on law enforcement practices and the impact they have on marginalized communities. The fight for justice and accountability is far from over, and the people of Charlotte are determined to make their voices heard. 

In the coming days, community leaders and activists are expected to organize further demonstrations and discussions aimed at addressing the issues at the heart of the protests. The call for justice for Kenneth L. Scott and the injured civilian is resonating far beyond Charlotte, as similar movements gain momentum across the nation, seeking to bring about change and hold law enforcement accountable for their actions.

As the protests unfold, the resilience of the community shines through, with demonstrators uniting in their demand for justice and an end to the violence that has plagued their neighborhoods. The tragic events of the past few days have only strengthened their resolve to fight for a better future, one where every citizen can feel safe and protected, rather than targeted and oppressed.

The city of Charlotte finds itself at a crossroads, facing a critical moment that could shape the future of its community. The response from local leaders, law enforcement, and the broader public will be pivotal in determining how this situation evolves and whether meaningful change can be achieved.

In the midst of the turmoil, the voices of the protesters remain steadfast, echoing the sentiments of countless others who have fought against injustice. ""We will not be silenced,"" they chant, a powerful reminder that the struggle for equality and justice is far from over. 

As the protests continue into the night, the world watches closely, hoping for a resolution that honors the memory of Kenneth L. Scott and addresses the systemic issues that have led to such tragic outcomes. The fight for justice is a long and arduous journey, but the people of Charlotte are committed to standing together, demanding accountability, and ensuring that their voices are heard. 

The aftermath of these events will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on the community, and as the dust settles, the call for reform and justice will persist. The eyes of the nation are on Charlotte, and the outcome of this moment could reverberate far beyond the city limits, influencing discussions around police conduct and community relations across the country.

In the days ahead, the community will continue to rally, united in their quest for justice, and determined to ensure that the legacy of Kenneth L. Scott is not forgotten. The protests may have begun in response to a tragedy, but they have evolved into a powerful movement advocating for change, accountability, and a brighter future for all.",-74.0,-55.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,1130.0,-1.3414634146341464,-0.048672566371681415
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

In the lead-up to the upcoming election, Republican nominee Donald Trump finds himself at the center of a growing controversy regarding his foreign policy and its apparent alignment with Russian interests. Critics have raised alarms over Trump's perceived support for Vladimir Putin, the Russian dictator, highlighting the potential implications for U.S. foreign policy should he assume the presidency.

One of the most troubling aspects of Trump's candidacy is the network of individuals around him who possess close ties to the Kremlin. This proximity has raised eyebrows, particularly in light of the support Trump has received from Russian state-controlled media and intelligence services. Such endorsements have fueled suspicions that his foreign policy could be unduly influenced by these connections, leading to questions about his commitment to American interests on the global stage.

Despite Trump's repeated assertions that he has no business ties to Russia, an investigation conducted by ABC News has uncovered numerous connections between Trump and Russian interests, revealing financial dealings amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. These revelations cast a long shadow over Trump's claims, suggesting that his financial entanglements could compromise his ability to prioritize U.S. foreign policy over personal gain.

Among the most notable dealings are Trump's profitable business ventures with Russian oligarchs. His hosting of the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and the sale of real estate to Russian buyers are just two examples of how he has engaged with individuals who have amassed significant wealth during Russia's transition to a free-market economy. This wealth, however, is often intertwined with the Putin regime, as these oligarchs leverage their financial power to support the government and, in some cases, launder money through Trump properties.

Former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev has characterized these oligarchs as materialistic and culturally ignorant, emphasizing their singular focus on personal wealth. This perspective raises concerns about the motivations behind their associations with Trump and the broader implications for U.S.-Russia relations.

The situation is further complicated by the U.S. State Department's sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs in 2014, which were intended to limit their financial activities in response to Russia's aggressive actions on the global stage. Critics fear that a Trump presidency could lead to the lifting of these sanctions, a move that would not only benefit Trump financially but also provide a significant boon to the oligarchs who have long supported the Putin regime.

This potential conflict of interest raises serious questions about Trump's ability to disentangle his personal financial interests from U.S. foreign policy regarding Russia. As the lines between personal profit and national interest blur, the implications for American diplomacy could be profound, particularly if Trump were to prioritize the desires of wealthy Russian allies over the strategic interests of the United States.

In light of these revelations, there is a growing chorus of voices calling for accountability. Many are urging Congress to take action against Trump, with some advocating for his impeachment should he win the presidency. The stakes are high, and the ramifications of a Trump administration could reverberate far beyond the borders of the United States.

As the election approaches, the scrutiny on Trump's foreign policy and financial dealings with Russia is only expected to intensify. Voters are left to ponder the implications of a leader whose past is intertwined with the very oligarchs that the U.S. government has sought to sanction. The potential for a compromised presidency raises fundamental questions about the integrity of American democracy and the principles that guide U.S. foreign relations.

In conclusion, the intersection of Trump's business dealings and his foreign policy stance presents a troubling picture. With calls for Congress to take action, the need for transparency and accountability has never been more critical. As the nation prepares to make a decision at the polls, the implications of Trump's connections to Russian interests loom large, leaving many to wonder what a Trump presidency might mean for the future of U.S.-Russia relations and the integrity of American foreign policy.",27.0,32.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,734.0,1.28,0.043596730245231606
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is now facing the looming threat of impeachment as the fallout from the controversial ""Bridgegate"" scandal continues to escalate. Top state legislators are reportedly weighing the possibility of filing articles of impeachment against Christie if he is found guilty of orchestrating the closure of the George Washington Bridge as a means to retaliate against a political rival.

The scandal, which has haunted Christie since its inception, centers on allegations that the governor was deeply involved in a scheme that led to significant traffic disruptions and even a tragic death due to delayed emergency services. Federal prosecutors have recently implicated Christie in the ongoing Bridgegate trial, which involves three of his former senior aides. These developments have intensified scrutiny on Christie's actions during the scandal, raising questions about his leadership and integrity.

As part of the legal proceedings, a judge has ordered Christie to produce personal emails related to the scandal, further complicating his position. The decision to move forward with impeachment proceedings lies in the hands of Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto. Should he approve, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would be responsible for handling the impeachment process.

For an impeachment to proceed, a majority of the 80-member Assembly must vote in favor. If that threshold is met, a two-thirds majority in the Senate would be required for a conviction. This makes the path to impeachment a challenging one, but the implications of the ongoing investigations could sway opinions within the Assembly.

Christie's political future is further complicated by his role as the transition team chairperson for Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump. His endorsement of Trump was seen as a significant political setback, especially considering that Christie had previously contemplated a run for the presidency himself. The intertwining of his gubernatorial duties and his involvement in national politics has created a precarious situation for the governor.

The Bridgegate scandal first erupted in January 2014, when Christie denied having any knowledge of the scheme during a press conference. However, revelations have since emerged indicating that Christie was informed about the bridge closure during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013. Despite being made aware of the situation, he did not take any action, raising further concerns regarding his judgment and accountability.

The fallout from the scandal has marked a dramatic decline for Christie, who was once considered a rising star within the Republican Party. The potential impeachment adds another layer of turmoil to an already tumultuous political landscape for the governor. As the situation unfolds, many are left wondering how Trump's camp will respond to the impeachment charges against Christie, particularly given their close association.

The public's attention remains fixed on the developments surrounding Christie, as the implications of the Bridgegate scandal ripple through the political arena.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In the realm of American politics, few figures have generated as much controversy as former President Donald Trump. A striking instance occurred during a Republican primary debate in September 2015, where Trump made a bold claim regarding his past dealings with casino gambling and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Trump asserted that he had never lobbied Bush for casino gambling, a declaration that raises significant questions about the truthfulness of his statements.

During the debate, Trump confidently stated that had he truly desired to secure casino gambling, he would have done so without issue. This assertion, however, has been called into question due to its stark contradiction with his earlier testimony in a civil court deposition. In that deposition, Trump admitted to actively pushing for casino gambling in Florida, a revelation that casts a shadow over his claims made during the debate.

The implications of Trump's statements are not merely a matter of political rhetoric; they suggest a potential pattern of dishonesty that has characterized his political dealings. The debate featured a tense exchange between Trump and Bush, where Bush accused Trump of attempting to influence his position on gambling legislation through financial contributions. This back-and-forth highlighted the contentious nature of their relationship and the stakes involved in the discussion surrounding gambling legislation in Florida.

Bush's accusation raised eyebrows, especially in light of Trump's denial during the debate. The juxtaposition of Trump's statements on national television with his sworn testimony in 2007 presents a troubling scenario. If Trump was indeed lying during the debate, it not only undermines his credibility but also raises the specter of perjury concerning his deposition. The legal ramifications of such dishonesty cannot be overlooked, as they echo the historical precedent set by the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, who faced significant consequences for lying under oath.

The significance of these allegations extends beyond mere political posturing. They highlight a broader concern regarding the integrity of public officials and their accountability to the electorate. If Trump deliberately misled the public during the debate, it calls into question the trust that voters place in their leaders. Furthermore, if he perjured himself in court, it raises serious legal implications that warrant investigation.

The article suggests that Trump may have lied during the debate to sidestep the embarrassment of admitting that he had lost to Bush on the gambling issue. This tactic of evasion is not new for Trump, who has often been criticized for his approach to political discourse, characterized by exaggeration and denial. The pattern of dishonesty observed in this instance is emblematic of a broader trend that has drawn scrutiny from both political opponents and legal experts alike.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of Trump's statements during the debate remain relevant. The call for accountability is louder than ever, with many advocating for Congress to take a closer look at Trump's alleged crimes. The notion that a former president may have engaged in dishonest behavior, whether in a public forum or under oath, raises fundamental questions about the standards to which elected officials should be held.

In conclusion, the claims made by Trump during the September 2015 Republican primary debate serve as a critical reminder of the importance of honesty and integrity in political discourse. The potential contradictions between his statements and previous testimony highlight the need for greater scrutiny of public figures and their actions. As the nation grapples with these issues, the call for accountability resonates strongly, urging Congress to address the allegations surrounding Trump's conduct. The future of American politics may very well depend on the willingness of its leaders to uphold the principles of honesty and transparency that are essential to a functioning democracy.",-29.0,-19.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,699.0,-0.7037037037037037,-0.027181688125894134
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers turned the recent CNN debate into a drinking game.
- The US Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, cautioned that drinking every time Donald Trump lies could lead to alcohol poisoning.
- Murthy previously warned about the dangers of drinking games during debates, especially in the context of Republican candidates.

- This averaged out to a lie every three minutes and 15 seconds, suggesting he may have told about 28 lies during the CNN debate.

In an unusual twist to political engagement, many viewers transformed the recent CNN debate into a drinking game, raising concerns about the potential health risks associated with such activities. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy cautioned that drinking every time former President Donald Trump lies could lead to severe consequences, including alcohol poisoning.

Murthy has previously expressed concerns about drinking games during political debates, particularly in relation to Republican candidates. His warnings are underscored by alarming statistics: in 2012, there were approximately 70,000 incidents related to alcohol poisoning during debates. The Surgeon General reiterated these warnings in 2016, prior to the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump, emphasizing the dangers of excessive drinking in this context.

A recent study by Politico highlighted the frequency of falsehoods from Trump, reporting that he told 87 lies over a five-day period leading up to the debate. This staggering average translates to a lie every three minutes and 15 seconds, suggesting that viewers could have expected Trump to make around 28 false statements during the CNN debate alone. Given this rate, the Surgeon General indicated that first responders were on alert for potential alcohol-related incidents following the debate.

As the political landscape heats up, Murthy's message is clear: viewers should drink responsibly during upcoming debates. The Surgeon General's warnings serve as a reminder of the importance of moderation, especially in light of Trump's tendency to mislead. With the stakes high and the potential for misinformation greater than ever, it is crucial for viewers to engage in political discourse without compromising their health.

In a time when the intersection of entertainment and politics is more pronounced, the combination of drinking games and debates raises important questions about responsibility and awareness. As the election season progresses, it remains vital for audiences to heed the advice of health officials, ensuring that their political engagement does not come at the cost of their well-being. As the nation gears up for more debates, the Surgeon General's cautions will likely resonate with viewers looking to navigate the often tumultuous waters of political discussions.",-17.0,-9.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,395.0,-0.6,-0.02278481012658228
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In the aftermath of a recent high-stakes debate, mainstream media outlets have widely declared former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the winner. However, a contrasting narrative has emerged from online polls and social media, where the hashtag #TrumpWon trended nationally, suggesting a different sentiment among the public.

The origins of the #TrumpWon hashtag have raised eyebrows, as it has been traced back to St. Petersburg, Russia. This revelation has sparked concerns about the influence of foreign entities in shaping American political discourse. Russian President Vladimir Putin is known for employing cyber-trolls as part of a broader strategy to advance his agenda through disinformation campaigns. These efforts are designed to create discord and amplify divisions among U.S. allies, undermining the stability of democratic processes.

Furthermore, Russian state-controlled media has been observed promoting Donald Trump to European audiences, reinforcing the notion that Putin may be seeking to manipulate the former president for his own gain. Analysts speculate that one of Putin's goals is to persuade Trump to lift sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs, which would benefit the Kremlin and its allies.

The working conditions for these Russian trolls have been described as harsh and draconian, akin to an ""internet sweat shop."" Ex-bloggers have recounted their experiences, detailing a strict environment where tardiness or failing to meet posting quotas can result in fines. With rigorous editorial oversight, these trolls are tasked with disseminating content that aligns with the Kremlin's narrative, raising questions about the authenticity of online interactions.

Given the potential manipulation of online polls and the influence of foreign disinformation, experts caution against placing undue trust in these digital platforms. Engaging with comments and trends that may be artificially generated could skew public perception and distort the political landscape.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call among some lawmakers for Congress to take action against Donald Trump. Advocates for impeachment argue that the former president's ties to foreign interference pose a threat to national security and democratic integrity.

As the debate continues, the implications of these online trends and foreign influences on American politics remain a critical topic for discussion. The intersection of social media, disinformation, and political strategy underscores the importance of vigilance in safeguarding democratic processes from external manipulation.",-9.0,-1.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,429.0,-0.058823529411764705,-0.002331002331002331
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

In a significant development for the tech industry, Palantir Technologies, a data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel, is facing a federal lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for alleged employment discrimination. The lawsuit specifically claims that Palantir systematically discriminated against Asian job applicants during its hiring processes.

The allegations stem from Palantir’s hiring practices for engineering intern positions, where a striking 73% of applicants were Asian. However, the hiring outcomes revealed a stark disparity: only four Asian applicants were hired compared to 17 non-Asian applicants. The DOL’s lawsuit posits that the likelihood of such a hiring outcome occurring by chance is an astonishing one in a billion, raising serious concerns about the fairness and integrity of Palantir’s hiring procedures.

The implications of these allegations are far-reaching, particularly given Palantir’s status as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA). The company’s role in national security and data analytics places it under scrutiny regarding adherence to federal employment regulations, especially those mandating non-discriminatory hiring practices.

Peter Thiel, who has been a prominent figure in both the tech world and political landscape, is at the center of this controversy. A first-generation immigrant himself, Thiel has been known for his support of Donald Trump, a figure whose immigration policies have drawn criticism and opposition from various groups. This juxtaposition adds a layer of complexity to the allegations against Palantir, as it raises questions about the company’s commitment to diversity and inclusion in its workforce.

Thiel’s career has been marked by significant achievements, including co-founding PayPal and making early investments in Facebook. However, he gained wider recognition as the benefactor of Hulk Hogan in a high-profile lawsuit against Gawker Media, which ultimately led to the bankruptcy of the media company. This incident has positioned Thiel as a controversial figure, often discussed in the context of his influence and financial power.

In addition to his business ventures, Thiel made headlines in 2016 when he became the first openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention. During his speech, he highlighted themes of government incompetence and expressed pride in his identity, a moment that resonated with many. However, it also underscored the contradictions within the Republican Party, which simultaneously passed an anti-LGBT platform, raising questions about the party’s stance on diversity and inclusion.

The Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) has emphasized the obligation of federal contractors like Palantir to ensure that their hiring practices are free from discrimination. This lawsuit serves as a reminder of the federal government’s commitment to enforcing equal opportunity in employment, particularly in companies that play a critical role in national security.

In response to the allegations, a spokeswoman for Palantir Technologies stated that the company intends to defend itself vigorously against the claims. The company’s commitment to addressing the lawsuit will be closely monitored, as it could have significant ramifications not only for Palantir but also for the broader tech industry and its hiring practices.

As the case unfolds, it will be crucial to observe how Palantir navigates these serious allegations and what measures, if any, the company will implement to ensure a fair and equitable hiring process moving forward. The outcome of this lawsuit could set important precedents regarding employment discrimination and the responsibilities of federal contractors in maintaining non-discriminatory practices.

In a landscape where diversity and inclusion are increasingly prioritized, Palantir’s situation highlights the ongoing challenges that many companies face in achieving equitable hiring outcomes. The tech industry, often viewed as a leader in innovation, must also grapple with its responsibilities to foster an inclusive workforce that reflects the diversity of the society it serves. As this lawsuit progresses, it will serve as a crucial test of Palantir’s commitment to these principles and its ability to uphold its reputation in a competitive and scrutinizing market.",-18.0,-2.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,740.0,-0.08,-0.002702702702702703

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

New York City police are actively investigating multiple leads related to the recent bombing in Chelsea, which left 29 people injured. The explosion, which occurred in a bustling neighborhood, has prompted a swift and thorough response from law enforcement as they work to uncover the identity of those responsible.

In a significant development, authorities discovered a second pressure-cooker bomb in a Dumpster located just four blocks from the initial explosion site. This discovery has raised concerns about the potential for further attacks and has intensified the urgency of the investigation.

Three key leads have emerged that may provide crucial insights into the case. The first lead involves a hand-written letter, partially written in Arabic, which was found alongside the second bomb. The contents of this letter are currently being analyzed by experts to determine its relevance to the ongoing investigation.

The second lead consists of a warning received by police through a 911 call. An unidentified male caller alerted authorities to the possibility of more explosions, ominously stating, “There will be more.” This warning has heightened fears among residents and officials alike, as the threat of additional violence looms.

The third lead is a Tumblr page that has garnered attention for its provocative content. Titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber,’ the page appears to serve as a manifesto for the individual claiming responsibility for the Chelsea bombing. The post expresses deep-seated anger towards societal views on the LGBTQ+ community and a range of other social issues. It claims that the bombings were tests for a larger agenda, suggesting that the author is driven by a desire to provoke change through violent means.

The author of the Tumblr post has made it clear that they intend to continue their actions, asserting that they will target those they perceive as threats to their cause. This chilling declaration has raised alarm among both law enforcement and community members, who are now grappling with the implications of such a mindset.

However, the legitimacy of the claims made in the Tumblr post is being questioned. Experts and investigators have expressed concerns that individuals may be exploiting the situation for attention, potentially complicating the investigation. As authorities sift through the myriad of information and leads, they remain vigilant in determining what is credible and what may be mere sensationalism.

As the investigation unfolds, the community remains on edge. The Chelsea bombing has not only caused physical injuries but has also instilled a sense of fear among residents and visitors alike. Local businesses are feeling the impact, with some reporting a decline in foot traffic as people remain cautious about their surroundings.

In response to the ongoing investigation, police have increased their presence in the area, reassuring the public that they are doing everything possible to ensure safety. Community leaders are also calling for vigilance and cooperation among residents to report any suspicious activity.

As investigators continue to follow these leads, the hope remains that they will be able to identify and apprehend those responsible for this dangerous act. The ramifications of the bombing extend beyond the immediate physical damage, affecting the fabric of the community and raising critical questions about safety, security, and the motivations behind such violent actions.

With the investigation still in its early stages, authorities are urging anyone with information related to the bombing or the leads that have emerged to come forward. The community’s cooperation could prove vital in bringing those responsible to justice and preventing further violence.",-25.0,-28.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,648.0,-1.037037037037037,-0.043209876543209874
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on September 25, 2016

As the countdown to the highly anticipated presidential debate approaches, concerns regarding Donald Trump's mental fitness have come to the forefront. With just under 24 hours left before the 90-minute showdown, Trump's recent behavior has raised eyebrows among political analysts and supporters alike.

The 70-year-old Republican nominee has been campaigning with relentless vigor, yet signs of fatigue are becoming increasingly apparent. The intense schedule has left Trump under significant pressure, with little time allocated for rest or recuperation. This demanding pace poses questions about his ability to perform effectively in the upcoming debate against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

Compounding these concerns, Trump took to social media to express his thoughts in a series of tweets that many have deemed incoherent. In a span of a few hours, he managed to touch on three unrelated and highly charged topics: murders committed by a Middle Eastern immigrant in Washington State, the alarming rise in drug overdose deaths in Ohio, and riots occurring in North Carolina. This erratic tweeting spree has been interpreted as a troubling indicator of a wandering mind, raising alarms about Trump's mental acuity and preparedness for the debate.

Political commentators suggest that Trump's ability to communicate effectively is deteriorating, which could have serious implications for his campaign. The stakes are particularly high as he prepares to face Clinton, a seasoned debater known for her articulate and strategic discourse. The juxtaposition of Trump's recent behavior with Clinton's polished communication skills could play a significant role in shaping voter perceptions in the critical days leading up to the election.

As the debate looms, the question remains: can Trump rally his focus and present a coherent argument under the spotlight? The outcome of this debate may not only impact his standing in the polls but could also determine the trajectory of his campaign as he vies for the presidency. With the political landscape shifting rapidly, observers will be watching closely to see if Trump can overcome these challenges and deliver a performance that resonates with voters.",-22.0,3.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,392.0,0.21428571428571427,0.007653061224489796

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point.

Delaware, Ohio - In a stark illustration of potential challenges ahead for her campaign, Hillary Clinton hosted a door-knocking event scheduled for 1 PM on a recent afternoon, but the turnout was far from what her team had anticipated. Only one individual, identified as a supporter of Donald Trump, showed up to document the event, leaving Clinton's staff with an empty venue and unanswered questions about her campaign's ground game.

The solitary Trump supporter, who arrived to capture the moment, was ultimately asked to leave after Clinton's staff recognized his affiliation. This unexpected turn of events highlighted not only the lack of attendees but also the growing polarization of the political landscape, where even a campaign event designed to engage voters could attract opposition rather than supporters.

Clinton's event was expected to draw a significant number of volunteers eager to rally behind her candidacy, especially as the election season heats up. However, the stark reality of the day was that only campaign staff members were present, leading to concerns about the former Secretary of State's ability to mobilize support in key battleground states.

The empty event raises critical questions about Clinton's campaign strategy and the potential for voter support as the election approaches. With Donald Trump’s rallies reportedly attracting thousands of enthusiastic supporters, Clinton's lack of engagement and enthusiasm on the ground is becoming increasingly evident. The stark contrast between the two candidates' ability to rally their bases could have significant implications for the election outcome.

Political analysts suggest that if similar low turnout events occur in other states, Clinton may face an uphill battle against Trump in the upcoming election. The absence of a robust ground game could hinder her ability to connect with voters and mobilize the grassroots support necessary to secure a victory. As the campaign progresses, the effectiveness of Clinton's outreach efforts will be scrutinized closely, particularly as she is still considered a frontrunner in the race.

The low turnout at the Delaware event is not an isolated incident; it reflects a broader trend of diminished enthusiasm for Clinton’s campaign. While she has maintained a favorable position in various polls, the reality of voter engagement is proving to be more complex. The empty chairs at the event symbolize a potential disconnect between Clinton and the electorate, raising alarms about her campaign’s viability.

In contrast, Trump’s rallies have been characterized by fervent crowds and high energy, suggesting that his messaging resonates more strongly with a segment of the population. This disparity in turnout and enthusiasm could be a telling indicator of the challenges that lie ahead for Clinton as she seeks to maintain her status as a leading candidate.

As the election cycle continues to unfold, the implications of this empty event in Delaware may reverberate throughout Clinton's campaign strategy. The need for a more effective ground game and a renewed focus on voter engagement is becoming increasingly apparent. Without addressing these concerns, Clinton could find herself struggling to compete against a formidable opponent like Trump, who has successfully galvanized a passionate base of supporters.

In conclusion, the low turnout at Hillary Clinton's door-knocking event in Ohio serves as a cautionary tale for her campaign. As the election draws closer, the ability to inspire and mobilize voters will be crucial to her success. The stark contrast in rally attendance between Clinton and Trump underscores the urgency for her team to reassess their strategies and reconnect with potential supporters before it’s too late.",-7.0,50.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,662.0,2.1739130434782608,0.0755287009063444

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In the wake of a recent bombing in New York City, reactions have poured in from various political figures, igniting a heated debate over terminology and media representation. Former President Donald Trump was quick to label the incident a ""bombing,"" a term that has since drawn criticism from major news outlets, particularly CNN.

CNN's response to Trump's use of the term has been a focal point of contention. The network criticized Trump for his choice of words, despite the fact that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also referred to the incident using the same terminology. This inconsistency did not go unnoticed, as CNN later edited their coverage to omit Clinton's reference to the bombing entirely, which has raised questions about media bias and fairness in reporting.

In a segment on Fox and Friends, Trump did not hold back in his criticism of CNN, calling the network ""disgusting and disgraceful"" for their handling of the situation. He accused CNN of dishonesty, further branding the network as the ""Clinton news network,"" a jab that highlights his long-standing grievances with the media’s portrayal of him and his political rivals.

The discussion surrounding the bombing has extended beyond media coverage and terminology. Trump took the opportunity to critique what he described as ""stupid"" leaders who have adopted a soft stance on terrorism. He emphasized the necessity for a tougher approach to combat the rising threat of terrorism, a theme that has resonated throughout his political career.

In addition to his critique of media coverage and political leadership, Trump expressed grave concerns regarding the influx of refugees into the United States. He specifically targeted former President Barack Obama’s plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees, arguing that such a policy is fraught with risks. Trump claimed that Clinton, if elected, would seek to increase that number significantly, which he believes poses a danger to national security.

Trump has consistently argued that the current vetting process for refugees is inadequate, raising alarms about the potential for individuals with malicious intent to slip through the cracks. This sentiment has been a cornerstone of his campaign rhetoric, appealing to a base that prioritizes national security and stringent immigration policies.

As the debate continues, the bombing incident has not only reignited discussions about terrorism and national security but has also spotlighted the role of media in shaping public perception. Critics of CNN argue that the network’s selective reporting undermines journalistic integrity, while supporters claim that it is crucial to hold public figures accountable for their statements.

In a climate where political tensions run high, the interplay between media coverage and political rhetoric remains a critical issue. The fallout from the New York City bombing has underscored the complexities of communication in the digital age, where every word can be scrutinized and interpreted through various lenses.

As the nation processes the implications of the bombing and the responses from political leaders, one thing is clear: the conversation surrounding terrorism, media representation, and public safety will continue to evolve. With figures like Trump at the forefront, the debate will likely remain contentious, reflecting the polarized nature of contemporary American politics.

In conclusion, the recent bombing in New York City has not only sparked immediate reactions from political figures but has also ignited a broader discussion about the responsibilities of media outlets and the importance of clear communication in addressing national security concerns. As the situation develops, the public will be watching closely to see how these narratives unfold and what impact they may have on future policies and political discourse.",-45.0,-17.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,676.0,-0.7391304347826086,-0.02514792899408284

Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

Elizabeth, New Jersey – Ahmad Rahami, a man previously convicted for his involvement in a series of bombings, has filed a controversial lawsuit against the local police department, claiming that his family faced discrimination rooted in their Afghan culture and Muslim identity. The lawsuit has sparked discussions about the treatment of minority communities in the wake of heightened security concerns.

Rahami's family, who have operated a chicken restaurant in Elizabeth since 2002, allege that their business has been subject to undue scrutiny and harassment by local officials. According to the lawsuit, the family claims that they were unfairly targeted by police for remaining open past 10 PM, despite having the necessary permissions to do so. This accusation raises questions about how local law enforcement interacts with businesses owned by members of minority communities.

The family reports a pattern of receiving numerous unjust tickets and court summons, which they believe are a direct result of their ethnic background. They allege that local residents have subjected them to racial abuse, including derogatory remarks about Muslims, further contributing to a hostile environment. Such claims highlight the challenges faced by immigrant families in maintaining their livelihoods while navigating systemic biases.

In addition to the alleged discrimination, the lawsuit accuses the Elizabeth police department of engaging in harassment and retaliation against the Rahami family’s business. The police reportedly expressed concerns about crime in the area surrounding the restaurant, which the family argues is a pretext for targeting them based on their cultural identity. The situation raises important questions about the balance between community safety and the rights of business owners, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds.

The context of the lawsuit is further complicated by Ahmad Rahami's criminal history. Five years after the incidents described in the lawsuit, he was arrested for planting bombs in New York City, an act that underscored his extremist behavior. This irony casts a shadow over the claims made in the lawsuit and raises questions about Rahami's motivations and the authenticity of his family's experiences.

As the lawsuit unfolds, it will likely draw attention to broader issues of discrimination, community relations, and the treatment of Muslim Americans in the wake of national security concerns. The Rahami family's allegations reflect a growing discourse on the need for law enforcement practices that are both effective in ensuring public safety and respectful of the rights and dignity of all community members.

The Elizabeth police department has yet to respond publicly to the lawsuit. As the legal proceedings progress, many will be watching closely to see how the court addresses these allegations and the implications they may have for policing and community relations in New Jersey and beyond.",-49.0,-42.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,502.0,-2.3333333333333335,-0.08366533864541832
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

The Clinton Foundation is under renewed scrutiny following allegations of pay-to-play corruption that suggest former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton granted political access to donors in exchange for contributions. Critics have raised concerns that the foundation, which was established to address global issues, primarily served as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates.

In defense of the foundation, the Clinton campaign has emphasized its charitable contributions, asserting that the organization has made a significant impact in various areas. However, a closer examination of the foundation's financial records reveals troubling trends. According to IRS filings from 2014, only 5.7% of the foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants, raising questions about its commitment to philanthropy.

In that year, the Clinton Foundation's total spending reached approximately $91.3 million, yet less than $5.2 million was directed toward charitable grants. In stark contrast, the foundation spent $34.8 million on salaries and employee benefits, alongside $50.4 million on ""other expenses."" This disproportionate allocation of funds has led critics to argue that the foundation's operations are more focused on enriching its staff than on fulfilling its charitable mission.

Moreover, the foundation's charitable spending saw a significant decrease of 40% in 2014, despite an influx of an additional $30 million in contributions that same year. This decline in charitable giving, coupled with a $5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, has further fueled allegations that the foundation is primarily a means for the Clintons to generate wealth. Critics contend that Hillary Clinton leveraged her position as Secretary of State to benefit financially, raising ethical concerns about the intersection of politics and philanthropy.

The ongoing allegations against the Clinton Foundation have reignited debates about transparency and accountability in charitable organizations, particularly those with ties to political figures. As the foundation continues to navigate these challenges, the implications of its financial practices remain a focal point for both supporters and detractors of the Clintons.

As the 2024 election cycle approaches, the scrutiny surrounding the Clinton Foundation may play a significant role in shaping public perception of Hillary Clinton and her political legacy. With questions about the foundation's financial integrity lingering, it remains to be seen how these allegations will impact the Clintons' standing in the political arena.",25.0,15.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,437.0,1.0,0.034324942791762014

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

Former President Barack Obama delivered a speech in New York City on Thursday, generating significant backlash from critics who felt his response to recent violent incidents was inadequate. The speech came in the wake of bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing in St. Cloud, Minnesota, which have raised concerns about domestic terrorism and public safety.

Instead of addressing the gravity of these attacks, Obama chose to focus his remarks on a high-dollar fundraiser, drawing ire from various quarters. Critics have described his response as tone-deaf and arrogant, suggesting that he is out of touch with the seriousness of the situation affecting many Americans. The decision to prioritize a fundraising event over acknowledging the victims of the recent violence has left many feeling frustrated and disillusioned.

Obama's speech primarily centered on issues of sexism in media, where he pointed fingers at prominent figures such as Rush Limbaugh and Fox News, blaming them for the challenges faced by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. While the discussion of sexism is undoubtedly important, critics argue that it overshadowed the immediate need for empathy and solidarity in the face of tragedy. 

In his remarks, Obama took the opportunity to criticize Donald Trump while praising Clinton, yet he failed to mention the victims of the bombings and stabbing. This omission has not gone unnoticed, with many commentators expressing outrage at his failure to acknowledge the domestic terrorism incidents that had unfolded just days prior. 

Critics contend that a simple acknowledgment of the attacks, coupled with thoughts and prayers for the victims, would have been appropriate and appreciated. Instead, Obama's focus on political discourse during such a tumultuous time has led to accusations of insensitivity. The sentiment among many observers is that his comments did not reflect the gravity of the current climate, which has left communities grappling with fear and uncertainty.

The backlash against Obama's speech highlights a broader concern about the disconnect between political leaders and the everyday experiences of citizens. As the nation grapples with rising tensions and incidents of violence, many are calling for leaders to prioritize compassion and unity over political agendas. The expectation is that in times of crisis, leaders should provide comfort and support to those affected, rather than diverting attention to campaign-related topics.

In the wake of the bombings and the stabbing, many Americans are seeking reassurance from their leaders, and Obama's decision to sidestep these pressing issues has sparked outrage. The expectation for a leader to respond to crises with empathy is a fundamental aspect of public service, and critics argue that Obama missed an opportunity to provide that reassurance.

As the nation continues to process the implications of the recent attacks, the call for leaders to be more attuned to the sentiments of their constituents grows louder. The events in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota serve as stark reminders of the challenges facing communities, and the need for political figures to engage with these realities in a meaningful way.

In conclusion, Obama's speech at the fundraiser has elicited a wave of criticism for its perceived insensitivity and lack of acknowledgment of the domestic terrorism incidents. As the nation searches for answers and healing, the hope remains that future leaders will demonstrate a greater awareness of the impact of their words and actions during times of crisis.",-25.0,-47.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,627.0,-2.1363636363636362,-0.07496012759170653
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!

Recent awareness of corruption at the Clinton Foundation has surged among the American public, fueled by a new report indicating that the organization is grappling with more serious issues than previously believed. The Daily Caller has revealed alarming practices by the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), which reportedly distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa.

A draft congressional report suggests that these compromised drugs may have heightened risks of morbidity and mortality among patients relying on them for treatment. CHAI is recognized as one of the Clinton Foundation's most significant and well-known initiatives, making these revelations particularly troubling.

The potential distribution of adulterated AIDS medications could lead to intensified scrutiny of the Clinton charity, especially during Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The congressional study also highlights questionable connections between Bill Clinton and two Indian-Americans who are currently under investigation by the FDA and SEC, raising further concerns about the foundation's operations.

Additionally, the report points to the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, a pharmaceutical company notorious for its history of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting to the FDA. These associations have raised alarms regarding the integrity of the foundation's initiatives and the safety of the medications distributed under its auspices.

As the investigation unfolds, it remains unclear how many AIDS patients may have received these diluted drugs, leaving many to question the impact on public health in the affected regions. The report has gone so far as to call for the immediate shutdown of the Clinton Foundation to prevent any further harm.

With these serious allegations coming to light, the future of the Clinton Foundation and its initiatives hangs in the balance, as both supporters and critics await further developments in this ongoing controversy.",-14.0,-24.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,327.0,-2.1818181818181817,-0.07339449541284404
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all. Because doesn’t government always know best?",http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,Mockarena Cotr,http://www.chicksontheright.com,{'$date': 1474332562000},,"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2fb62ae885c1cdb2a0c69249a9c25a?s=120&d=mm&r=g,http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN#!,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cotrolog-smalll.png,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CotR_banner1-copy-2.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8W3QtpyKy7xuZ.gif,http://rightchicks.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/book-thumb.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49-812x478.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kardashian-jenner-424x250.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d1x2X8_nNBHjc.gif",https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/,"{""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Chicks On The Right"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 812, ""identifier"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""height"": 550}, ""url"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""image"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""card"": ""summary"", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right""}, ""robots"": ""noodp"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/"", ""section"": ""Constitution"", ""tag"": ""felony"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-19T20:49:22-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}","- Arizona state legislature criticized for poorly worded laws affecting parenting activities.

The Arizona state legislature is facing significant criticism for a recently enacted law that has raised alarms among parents and legal experts alike. The legislation, which criminalizes any contact between an adult and a child's genitals, has been deemed poorly worded and overly broad, leading to fears that innocent parenting activities could be misconstrued as felonies.

Under the new law, everyday actions such as changing diapers or bathing children could potentially expose parents to severe legal repercussions. While the law was intended to protect children from molesters, critics argue that it fails to achieve this goal due to its ineffective and vague language. The implications of this law have sparked a heated debate about the balance between child protection and parental rights.

In a recent ruling, the Arizona Supreme Court reassured the public that prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents for acts carried out in innocence. However, this reassurance does little to alleviate the concerns surrounding the burden placed on defendants. Under the law, individuals accused of offenses must prove a lack of sexual intent, effectively challenging the presumption of innocence that is a cornerstone of the American legal system.

Legal experts warn that this shift in the burden of proof could have far-reaching consequences. Defendants may find themselves in a precarious position, where they must navigate a system that could easily misinterpret their intentions. The potential for plea bargaining further complicates matters, as individuals may feel pressured to admit guilt to avoid the possibility of harsher penalties, even when they have committed no wrongdoing.

Another troubling aspect of the law is the possibility that prosecutors could leverage child molestation charges to coerce parents into accepting plea deals. This tactic could lead to unjust outcomes, where innocent parents are forced to navigate a legal minefield simply for engaging in routine caregiving activities. Critics argue that this not only infringes on constitutional rights but also disproportionately targets parents and caregivers, placing them under undue scrutiny.

The ramifications of this law extend beyond individual cases; there are growing concerns that due process could be suspended for Arizona's parents if the U.S. Supreme Court does not intervene. The potential for such a scenario raises fundamental questions about the rights of parents and the role of the government in private family matters.

Ironically, the very system designed to protect children may inadvertently create an environment of distrust between parents and the government. Many parents are left grappling with the reality that their everyday actions could be misinterpreted as criminal behavior, leading to a chilling effect on parental involvement and care.

As Arizona navigates the complexities of this law, the conversation surrounding parental rights, child protection, and the legislative process continues to evolve. The criticism of the law underscores the necessity for clear and effective legislation that truly serves the interests of children while safeguarding the rights of parents. The ongoing debate highlights the importance of ensuring that protections for children do not come at the expense of innocent caregivers who are simply fulfilling their responsibilities as parents.",-12.0,-29.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,557.0,-1.380952380952381,-0.05206463195691203
Fake_73-Webpage,Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?,"Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As the political landscape evolves, Michelle Obama’s presence in the public eye remains a topic of considerable discussion. Recent reports suggest that she will not be leaving the White House, with speculated roles being proposed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This development raises questions about the future of the Obamas and their influence on American politics, especially as the nation navigates complex issues surrounding education and child-rearing.

While the prospect of Michelle Obama continuing her involvement in government is met with mixed feelings, some critics express discomfort at the idea of ongoing coverage of the Obamas. The former First Lady has been a prominent figure since her husband, Barack Obama’s, presidency, and her continued visibility could reignite debates surrounding her legacy. Critics have voiced their discontent over specific aspects of Michelle Obama’s initiatives, notably her school lunch program, which aimed to improve the nutritional quality of meals provided in schools. This initiative, while well-intentioned, faced backlash from various quarters, with detractors arguing that it imposed unnecessary regulations on schools and families.

Additionally, Michelle Obama’s past statements, particularly her expression of pride in the United States, have drawn scrutiny. Such remarks have been polarizing, with some interpreting them as disconnected from the realities faced by many Americans. This criticism raises questions about her qualifications for any potential new role in a Clinton administration, especially as the former Secretary of State seeks to cultivate a voter base that resonates with the Obamas’ image.

Hillary Clinton’s beliefs regarding government influence in child-rearing have also surfaced amidst this speculation. Clinton has long advocated for the government to play a role in supporting families, a stance that some view as an encroachment on parental responsibilities. This perspective has sparked concerns about the implications of progressive control over education and government, particularly as it pertains to the upbringing of children. The notion that government could act as a parental figure has left some parents uneasy, leading to a broader discourse about the role of public policy in family life.

In light of these discussions, Michelle Obama has reaffirmed her commitment to her healthy living campaign for children, declaring that her efforts in this arena will continue indefinitely. This pledge underscores her dedication to improving the well-being of the nation’s youth, even as she faces criticism and challenges regarding her initiatives. The ongoing commitment to health and nutrition for children reflects a broader societal concern about childhood obesity and related health issues.

The author of this article perceives a strategic maneuver by Hillary Clinton to appeal to voters who hold a favorable view of the Obamas, despite their reservations about Clinton herself. This approach may be an attempt to leverage the Obama legacy to bolster support for Clinton’s political ambitions. However, such tactics raise questions about the authenticity of political endorsements and the implications for voter trust.

As the dialogue surrounding Michelle Obama and her potential future roles continues, it is essential to consider the ramifications of her involvement in government. The intersection of education, nutrition, and parental authority remains a contentious issue, and the influence of high-profile figures like Michelle Obama could shape the future of these discussions. With the ongoing evolution of the political landscape, the Obamas’ legacy will undoubtedly remain a focal point, prompting further examination of their impact on American society and governance. 

In summary, Michelle Obama’s potential roles in the future, the criticism of her past initiatives, and the implications of progressive policies on family life all contribute to a complex narrative that is likely to unfold in the coming months. As the nation grapples with these issues, the Obamas’ influence on the political discourse will continue to be a topic of keen interest and debate.",6.0,14.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,711.0,0.56,0.01969057665260197

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A new scandal has emerged surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), with serious allegations claiming that the organization distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa. This troubling development raises significant concerns about the quality of care provided to vulnerable populations battling the disease and suggests that the initiative may have contributed to numerous preventable deaths.

The allegations center on the involvement of Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, which has a controversial history regarding drug quality. In 2013, Ranbaxy was found guilty of multiple counts of fraud and introducing adulterated drugs into commerce, resulting in a staggering $500 million fine. This legal history casts a long shadow over the company’s practices and raises questions about its reliability as a supplier of essential medications.

A congressional report titled ""The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,"" initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, has shed light on the troubling relationship between CHAI and Ranbaxy. The report emphasizes the critical need to examine the consequences of distributing ineffective drugs, questioning how many lives may have been lost as a result of the initiative’s actions. It also highlights the false promises made to patients who relied on these medications for their health and survival.

Criticism of the Clinton Foundation has intensified, particularly regarding its promotion of Ranbaxy despite the company's documented history of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This relationship raises ethical concerns about the foundation’s commitment to health and well-being, especially when the lives of individuals in dire need of effective treatment are at stake.

In 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy, which resulted in the distribution of over 1.8 million packages of substandard HIV medicines. This decision has come under scrutiny, with critics arguing that it reflects a disregard for the safety and health of patients who depend on these medications. The revelation that Ranbaxy's generic drugs have been banned in the U.S. yet continue to be sold and distributed globally raises further alarm about the oversight and accountability of drug distribution practices.

The implications of these allegations are profound, as they suggest a prioritization of monetary gain over the welfare of individuals in need. The Clinton Foundation, known for its charitable initiatives, is now faced with questions about its integrity and commitment to ethical practices in healthcare. The report underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in organizations that claim to prioritize public health.

As the scandal unfolds, the potential impact on public trust in health initiatives and charitable organizations is significant. The distribution of substandard medications not only jeopardizes patient health but also undermines the credibility of organizations that advocate for access to essential treatments. With many patients relying on these medications for their survival, the stakes could not be higher.

The ongoing investigation into the relationship between CHAI and Ranbaxy will likely continue to draw attention, particularly as more information comes to light regarding the extent of the alleged distribution of ineffective drugs. Lawmakers and health advocates are calling for a thorough examination of the practices involved and a commitment to ensuring that such failures do not happen again.

In light of these allegations, there is a growing demand for greater oversight and regulation of drug distribution practices, particularly in regions where access to healthcare is already limited. The scandal serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of prioritizing profit over patient safety in the pharmaceutical industry.

The Clinton Health Access Initiative has long been viewed as a champion for global health, particularly in the fight against HIV/AIDS. However, the emergence of this scandal threatens to tarnish that reputation and raises critical questions about the efficacy of its programs and partnerships. As the investigation continues, the focus will remain on the lives impacted by these decisions and the need for accountability in healthcare initiatives.

In conclusion, the allegations surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its connection to Ranbaxy underscore the urgent need for vigilance in the pharmaceutical sector, especially when it concerns the health of vulnerable populations. As the fallout from this scandal unfolds, the emphasis on ethical practices and the commitment to quality healthcare must be paramount to restore trust and ensure that individuals receive the effective treatments they deserve. The potential loss of lives due to substandard medications is a sobering reminder of the responsibilities held by organizations in the field of public health.",-63.0,-29.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,827.0,-1.0,-0.03506650544135429

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant legal development, a federal judge has mandated that the State Department release documents pertaining to the security training of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her aides within a strict timeline. Judge Richard Leon, presiding over the case, ruled in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF) in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit, rejecting the State Department's motion to dismiss the case.

The lawsuit initiated by TheDCNF seeks to obtain records that would confirm whether Clinton and her key aides—Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, and Jacob Sullivan—completed the mandatory security training and briefings that are typically required for individuals in high-level government positions. The absence of these records has raised questions about compliance with security protocols during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.

Judge Leon's ruling reflects a growing frustration with the State Department's handling of the FOIA request. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the delays that have characterized the agency's response to the request, emphasizing the importance of transparency in government operations. In his order, the judge directed that one-third of the total 400 documents be released by September 26, with the remaining records due by October 10.

Attorney Bradley Moss, who is involved in the case, highlighted the judge's evident frustration with the State Department's obstruction of the FOIA process. Moss noted that such delays undermine public trust and hinder accountability, particularly when it comes to the actions of individuals in positions of power.

The State Department's failure to produce documents confirming the completion of security training raises serious concerns. In a statement, the agency acknowledged that their inability to provide these records suggests that the required security courses were not completed by Clinton or her aides. This admission adds another layer to the ongoing scrutiny surrounding Clinton's use of a private email server during her time in office, a controversy that has persisted for years.

The implications of this ruling extend beyond the immediate request for documents. It underscores the broader issues of transparency and accountability within government agencies, particularly regarding the handling of sensitive information. The FOIA process is designed to ensure that the public has access to government records, and the judge's order serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding these principles.

TheDCNF's pursuit of these records is part of a larger effort to shed light on the security measures that were in place during Clinton's tenure. The outcome of this case could have ramifications for how future FOIA requests are handled, particularly in relation to high-profile figures and sensitive government operations.

As the deadline for the release of documents approaches, all eyes will be on the State Department to see if they comply with the court's order. The decision to release these records may provide valuable insights into the security training protocols that were followed, or lack thereof, by Clinton and her aides.

In conclusion, Judge Leon's ruling marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing examination of Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information and security protocols during her time as Secretary of State. The forthcoming release of documents could potentially clarify the extent to which Clinton and her aides adhered to mandatory security training requirements, while also highlighting the importance of transparency in government operations. The case serves as a reminder of the critical role that the FOIA plays in ensuring accountability and fostering public trust in government institutions.",-5.0,-7.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,641.0,-0.3181818181818182,-0.0109204368174727
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the nation gears up for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, significant questions are being raised about the role of fact-checking in the discourse. NBC News has reported that Lester Holt, the debate's moderator, will not engage in real-time fact-checking of the candidates' statements. This decision allows Trump to make unverified claims without facing immediate accountability, aside from potential challenges from Clinton.

The absence of on-screen fact-checking is not limited to NBC; major cable news networks such as Univision and Telemundo have also announced that they will refrain from providing real-time verification of the candidates' statements. This raises the stakes for the debate, placing the burden of maintaining honesty squarely on Holt’s shoulders. 

Trump's track record of dishonesty is well-documented, with reports indicating he lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes. This pattern of behavior amplifies concerns regarding the necessity of fact-checking during the debate. Clinton's campaign has emphasized the importance of the moderator actively calling out lies as they occur, arguing that this is vital for ensuring a fair and balanced debate. 

However, Clinton faces a daunting challenge. The dynamics of the debate appear skewed, as she is expected to outperform Trump despite the absence of scrutiny on his statements. This double standard raises questions about the fairness of the debate format and the implications it has for both candidates. Without support in the form of immediate fact-checking, it may prove difficult for Clinton to convincingly demonstrate her superiority in the face of Trump's unverified assertions.

The current election cycle has prompted a broader discussion about the state of journalism and its role in political debates. The decision to forego fact-checking during such a critical event reflects a concerning trend in the media landscape, where the responsibility of truth-telling is increasingly placed on moderators rather than being a shared duty among all participants. 

As the debate approaches, observers are left to ponder the implications of this lack of accountability. The pessimistic view on the state of journalism suggests that without rigorous fact-checking, the integrity of the debate may be compromised, leading to an environment where misinformation can thrive unchecked. In this context, the responsibility falls heavily on Holt to navigate the complexities of the debate and ensure that the American public receives a fair and honest portrayal of the candidates' positions. 

As the first debate looms, the stakes have never been higher, and the eyes of the nation will be watching closely to see how the absence of fact-checking influences the discourse between these two prominent candidates.",-6.0,15.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,481.0,0.8333333333333334,0.031185031185031187
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

Dolly Kyle, a longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton, has voiced significant concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency. In a recent interview, Kyle articulated her belief that Clinton's current state of mind and physical health could hinder her ability to effectively lead the nation.

Kyle claims that Hillary Clinton is driven by ""anger and rage,"" emotions that she warns could potentially lead to a physical breakdown. According to Kyle, these intense feelings are symptomatic of deeper issues that Clinton is facing, which she describes as cognitive impairment. She suggests that this impairment is evident through various troubling symptoms, including emotional instability, memory loss, and difficulty in managing tasks that would be essential for a presidential candidate.

In her assessment, Kyle does not shy away from labeling Clinton's behavior as concerning. She describes Clinton as exhibiting paranoia and controlling tendencies, traits that Kyle argues are detrimental for someone seeking the highest office in the land. These characteristics, according to Kyle, could compromise Clinton's decision-making abilities and overall effectiveness as a leader.

Kyle's remarks are underscored by her recent book, ""Hillary the Other Woman,"" which she authored to shed light on what she perceives as the truth about Clinton, particularly focusing on her health issues. The book aims to provide a comprehensive view of Clinton's challenges, which Kyle believes are critical to understanding the former Secretary of State's candidacy.

Moreover, Kyle accuses Clinton of being ""addicted to power,"" suggesting that her ambition could lead her to jeopardize not only her health but also the integrity of the Democratic Party. This assertion comes at a time when Clinton's image and leadership capabilities are under intense scrutiny, raising questions about her readiness to take on the responsibilities of the presidency.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, Kyle's comments add to the ongoing discourse surrounding Hillary Clinton's character, health, and overall fitness to lead. The intersection of personal health and political ambition remains a focal point of concern, with Kyle's perspective serving as a stark reminder of the complexities involved in evaluating a candidate's readiness for office.

With the presidential race heating up, Kyle's revelations invite further examination of the qualities that voters seek in their leaders, particularly in an era where health and emotional stability are seen as vital attributes for effective governance.",-13.0,2.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,458.0,0.13333333333333333,0.004366812227074236

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

In a landscape often characterized as a ""nation of immigrants"" and a ""melting pot,"" the conversation surrounding the integration of newcomers into American and Canadian societies continues to gain traction. While the rich tapestry of cultures is celebrated, the emphasis on unity and adaptation to the host country's customs and traditions remains a focal point of discussion.

A Quebec mayor recently stirred controversy by asserting that Muslim refugees must understand the importance of integrating into Canadian culture. His comments reflect a broader sentiment that, while Canadians are not inherently racist or xenophobic, there is an expectation that immigrants will embrace the values and traditions of their new home. He emphasized that Canada has welcomed many immigrants from diverse backgrounds, yet he firmly believes that the essence of Canadian identity and culture should not be compromised for the sake of accommodating newcomers.

The mayor’s remarks extend to the realm of religion, where he stated that personal beliefs should remain a private matter within Canada. This is particularly pertinent in discussions surrounding Islam and the implementation of Sharia law. The insistence on maintaining a separation between personal faith and public life underscores a desire for a cohesive national identity that prioritizes the cultural norms of the host country.

In a more provocative stance, the mayor suggested that Muslims who find themselves uncomfortable with Canadian culture might consider returning to one of the 57 Muslim countries available to them. This assertion raises questions about the expectations placed on immigrants and the balance between cultural preservation and integration. Critics argue that such views can foster division rather than promote understanding.

Similarly, in Texas, there is a growing movement to prevent the implementation of Sharia law within the state's judicial system. This initiative highlights a broader trend across North America, where some lawmakers and community leaders are advocating for a clear delineation between religious practices and the legal frameworks that govern society. The aim is to ensure that the majority culture is not overshadowed by minority practices, reinforcing the idea that immigrants should adopt the host culture or reconsider their decision to settle.

The debate surrounding immigrant integration is multifaceted, with strong opinions on both sides. Advocates for a more inclusive approach argue that diversity enriches society and that immigrants should be allowed to maintain their cultural identities while contributing to the broader community. Conversely, proponents of the integrationist perspective assert that for a nation to function cohesively, newcomers must adapt to the established customs and traditions.

Critics of the integrationist stance often highlight the potential for discrimination and the dangers of a narrative that positions immigrants as outsiders. They argue that such perspectives can lead to a culture of exclusion rather than one of acceptance and understanding. However, the call for unity and a shared national identity remains a powerful sentiment among those who fear that the core values of their society may be diluted.

As the discussions around immigration and integration continue to evolve, the challenge lies in finding a balance that respects the rights and identities of all individuals while fostering a strong sense of community. The ongoing dialogue emphasizes the need for mutual respect and understanding, where both immigrants and the host society can coexist and thrive.

In conclusion, the conversation around immigrant integration in North America is complex and often contentious. It necessitates a careful consideration of cultural preservation, individual rights, and the collective identity of the nation, highlighting the importance of unity in an increasingly diverse society.",12.0,22.0,577.0,0.4444444444444444,0.02079722703639515,650.0,0.9166666666666666,0.033846153846153845

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

A recent incident in North Carolina has sparked discussions about safety and appropriate responses during protests. A white man driving through a demonstration organized by Black Lives Matter found himself surrounded by protesters, leading to tense moments that could have escalated.

Witnessing the event, a photographer initially believed the man was in danger of being mugged, given the circumstances of being encircled by a large group of demonstrators. However, contrary to expectations, the protesters allowed the man to pass without incident. This unexpected turn of events has drawn attention to the dynamics between individuals and protest groups.

In a surprising move, the man indicated that he was armed by waving a handgun out of his car window. This action prompted an immediate response from the protesters, who quickly dispersed upon seeing the weapon. The sight of the firearm created a clear shift in the atmosphere, raising questions about the implications of such an encounter.

The incident highlights the complexities of interactions between armed individuals and protest movements, particularly in light of ongoing discussions about race, safety, and the right to protest. The presence of a weapon in this scenario raises critical questions about what constitutes an appropriate response in such situations. 

While the protesters chose to retreat rather than confront the armed driver, the decision to display a firearm has broader implications for public safety and the nature of protests. The incident serves as a reminder of the potential volatility that can arise when firearms are introduced into situations already marked by tension and conflict.

As communities continue to grapple with issues of race and justice, this incident underscores the need for dialogue about safety protocols and the responsibilities of both protesters and individuals who may find themselves in similar situations. With emotions running high in discussions surrounding social justice, the intersection of armed individuals and protest movements remains a topic of concern and debate.",-18.0,-16.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,358.0,-1.1428571428571428,-0.0446927374301676
Fake_8-Webpage,The Black Sphere with Kevin Jackson,"Chicago Environmentalist Scumbags

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago environmentalists are under fire for what critics describe as blatant hypocrisy regarding their support for local development projects. Observers note a trend among leftist groups who champion environmental causes until those issues directly impact their interests. 

Previously, these environmentalists vehemently opposed filmmaker George Lucas’s plans to build a museum in the city, claiming it would harm the local environment. However, the same groups are now expressing enthusiastic support for the construction of the Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park, a project that will necessitate the destruction of trees and grass in the area.

Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, has publicly voiced her excitement about the Obama center, igniting further scrutiny of the environmentalists' seemingly contradictory stance. Critics argue that this shift in support contradicts the very principles outlined in the environmentalists' own charter. 

Notably, the Lucas museum was proposed to be built on a parking lot, which would have minimized its ecological impact compared to the Obama center's plans. This inconsistency raises questions about the motivations behind the environmentalists' decisions and suggests a potential racial double standard in their advocacy. 

As the debate continues, many are left wondering how these environmental groups reconcile their actions with their stated mission. The situation has sparked a broader conversation about the complexities of urban development, environmental stewardship, and the implications of racial dynamics in community decision-making.

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

General Stanley McChrystal, who served as the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, found himself at the center of a significant political and military clash during his tenure. Known for his strategic leadership, McChrystal had frequent disagreements with President Barack Obama regarding the conduct of the war, which ultimately led to a pivotal meeting in the Oval Office.

Anticipating the end of his Army career, McChrystal entered the meeting with Obama, where tensions ran high. During this confrontation, Obama accused McChrystal of failing to support him politically. In a remarkable display of duty and integrity, McChrystal responded by clarifying that his allegiance was to Obama as Commander-in-Chief, not as a politician. Following this declaration, McChrystal submitted his resignation, a move that underscored the deepening rift between military leadership and the Obama administration.

The meeting took a turn when Obama, rather than accepting the resignation gracefully, made a derogatory remark about McChrystal's feelings after his death. In a moment that reflected both the tension and the respect inherent in military protocol, McChrystal saluted and remarked that he would not stand in line again after leaving the Army, implying he wouldn’t cut in line at Obama’s grave.

This incident highlights the complex relationship between military leaders and political figures, particularly in times of war. Despite the controversies surrounding his resignation, General McChrystal's honorable character and commitment to his duty remain evident, marking him as a notable figure in the history of US military leadership.",7.0,-1.0,294.0,0.4666666666666667,0.023809523809523808,292.0,-0.1,-0.003424657534246575

They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm. Shut up. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

In the wake of recent riots in Charlotte, North Carolina, alarming revelations have emerged regarding the origins and motivations of those involved. Reports indicate that over 70% of the rioters were not local residents, but rather individuals who traveled from out of state. This has raised questions about the organization and intent behind the unrest, suggesting that the events were not merely spontaneous reactions to local issues, but rather part of a larger, well-orchestrated operation.

Eyewitness accounts and investigations have revealed that many of the rioters possessed out-of-state identification. This detail has led some officials to characterize the situation as a planned incursion rather than a grassroots movement. The head of the police union in Charlotte went so far as to label the rioters as ""professional criminals"" who were brought in specifically to incite violence and chaos.

Amidst these troubling developments, allegations have surfaced that the Black Lives Matter movement was involved in busing individuals into various cities, including Charlotte. While reports suggest that Tulsa saw no unrest, the contrast in responses to similar situations raises concerns. In Tulsa, the situation was reportedly diffused following the charging of a police officer involved in a controversial shooting, a move that did not occur in Charlotte and may have contributed to the heightened tensions there.

The narrative surrounding the riots has taken a more sinister turn, with claims that external actors, possibly with communist affiliations, are actively working to incite outrage and manipulate the black community for their own agenda. This assertion posits that the unrest in Charlotte is part of a broader scheme to create chaos and race riots, suggesting that the true interests of the rioters lie not in addressing the legitimate concerns of the community, but rather in fostering disorder.

CNN has also weighed in on the situation, reporting that the unrest in Charlotte appears to be driven by outside entities rather than local residents. This perspective aligns with the growing concern that organized groups are exploiting racial tensions for their own purposes, further complicating the dialogue surrounding race relations and community grievances.

The implications of these findings are significant. If the majority of those involved in the riots are indeed from outside the community, it raises critical questions about the nature of the protests and the motivations behind them. Are these events truly reflective of local frustrations, or are they being manipulated by external forces seeking to advance a particular agenda?

Moreover, the suggestion that the riots are being orchestrated by individuals more interested in chaos than in addressing the pressing issues facing the black community is particularly troubling. It underscores a potential disconnect between the genuine grievances of local residents and the actions of those who may not have a vested interest in the community's well-being.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of the riots, the focus is likely to shift toward understanding the complexities of the situation. Local leaders, law enforcement, and community members will need to navigate these turbulent waters carefully, ensuring that the voices of those genuinely affected by systemic issues are heard, while also addressing the challenges posed by external actors intent on sowing discord.

In conclusion, the situation in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the multifaceted nature of social unrest. While the community's concerns regarding racial injustice and police violence are valid and deserve attention, the infiltration of outside elements complicates the narrative and raises critical questions about the true motivations behind the recent chaos. As the dust settles, it will be essential for local leaders to distinguish between genuine community voices and those seeking to exploit the situation for their own ends.",-17.0,-44.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,675.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.06518518518518518
Fake_82-Webpage,Hillary's DEAD!?!? Brand New Theory Has Serious PROOF,"Hillary Clinton’s health is the top issue in the Presidential campaign. Once considered a “conspiracy theory,” Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases.

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!

As the Presidential campaign heats up, Hillary Clinton's health has emerged as a significant concern. Claims suggesting that she suffers from serious health issues, including neurological diseases, are gaining traction among the public and media alike. This scrutiny intensified following her collapse and fainting incident on September 11, which has led even her supportive media outlets to acknowledge the ongoing health issues surrounding the former Secretary of State.

Amid these concerns, expert Clif Hite has introduced a controversial theory, positing that Clinton may have died and is allegedly being replaced by body doubles and CGI images. If substantiated, this theory would represent one of the most significant cover-ups in American political history. 

Further complicating the narrative, reports indicate that Russian intelligence is utilizing video evidence to assert that Clinton has not left her Chelsea apartment and is instead using doubles. This has raised alarms about the authenticity of her public appearances and the potential implications for her campaign.

Additionally, there are allegations surrounding a secret plane crash involving Clinton, which purportedly resulted in serious injuries. These claims have been echoed by figures such as Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan, who previously reported on the alleged incident.

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC.

In a significant political development, Discover the Networks has identified 187 groups funded by billionaire George Soros that are actively opposing presidential candidate Donald Trump. Among these organizations is a newly formed political action committee (PAC) named Common Defense PAC, which has emerged with a clear mission: to protect the rights of Americans by opposing Trump.

Common Defense PAC has garnered attention not only for its anti-Trump stance but also for its leadership team, which comprises military veterans. However, the organization has faced scrutiny due to a lack of publicly available contact information for its leadership, raising questions about transparency and accountability.

The PAC has established a strong online presence by sharing anti-Trump content and collaborating with other Soros-funded PACs. A notable aspect of their campaign is the promotion of the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which has gained traction and is supported by the progressive organization MoveOn.org. This partnership has amplified their message and broadened their reach among voters who oppose Trump’s candidacy.

In an effort to mobilize support, Common Defense PAC participated in a Thunderclap campaign titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump. This initiative proved to be quite successful, reaching over 4.5 million people and further solidifying the PAC's commitment to opposing the Trump campaign.

In addition to their online campaigns, Common Defense PAC has also engaged in direct activism. They organized a protest aimed at pressuring Senator John McCain to withdraw his endorsement of Trump, showcasing their willingness to confront political figures who align with the controversial candidate.

Financially, Common Defense PAC’s July filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) revealed that they have received contributions from only one donor, Marjorie Roswell, who donated $20,000. This limited funding base has raised eyebrows among critics, who question the viability and legitimacy of the PAC, especially given its reliance on a single donor.

The PAC is led by Perry O’Brien, a left-wing activist who identifies as a conscientious objector. O’Brien has a history of involvement in anti-war efforts, which aligns with the PAC’s broader mission to oppose Trump’s policies and rhetoric. However, some critics argue that the PAC's representation of veterans is not as comprehensive as it claims. They point out that the organization appears to be primarily driven by O’Brien, raising doubts about the extent to which it reflects the views of a diverse group of veterans.

As Common Defense PAC continues to navigate the political landscape, it faces the challenge of establishing itself as a credible voice among the multitude of anti-Trump organizations funded by Soros. The PAC's ability to connect with a wider audience and attract more support will likely determine its impact on the upcoming election.

In conclusion, the emergence of Common Defense PAC highlights the ongoing polarization in American politics, particularly as the 2024 presidential election approaches. With its focus on opposing Trump and its connections to Soros-funded groups, the PAC aims to mobilize veterans and concerned citizens alike in a bid to influence the electoral outcome. Whether it can achieve its goals and resonate with a broader audience remains to be seen, but its activities will undoubtedly contribute to the larger narrative surrounding the election and the various factions at play.",8.0,16.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,609.0,0.7272727272727273,0.026272577996715927

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

In a story that has resurfaced from 2015, former President Barack Obama’s administration is facing renewed scrutiny for the allocation of $770 million in taxpayer funds used to renovate mosques overseas. While the story received minimal media attention at the time, it has now ignited debates over the appropriateness of such expenditures in light of ongoing domestic economic challenges.

Critics of the funding argue that the renovation of mosques abroad raises significant concerns about inadvertently supporting groups that may have ties to terrorism. The funds, as revealed in a CBS investigation, were allocated by the Obama State Department as part of a broader initiative aimed at fostering goodwill in predominantly Muslim countries. The rationale behind this funding was to build relationships with Islamic leaders, with the hope that such connections would help combat extremism.

However, taxpayer advocates have expressed outrage over the decision to spend taxpayer money on religious structures located outside of the United States. Jared Thomas, a prominent taxpayer advocate, criticized the spending as irresponsible, especially given that it is financed through national debt. “In a time when many Americans are facing significant economic struggles, it is unacceptable to be using taxpayer dollars in this manner,” Thomas stated.

The article highlights the economic climate in the U.S., where significant unemployment rates and ongoing economic challenges have left many Americans struggling to make ends meet. Critics argue that the focus should be on addressing these domestic issues rather than funding renovations for religious buildings in foreign nations. The juxtaposition of these two realities has led to calls for greater accountability and transparency regarding government spending practices.

In response to inquiries regarding the funding, the State Department declined to provide an interview but did issue a statement emphasizing that the funding was intended to foster relationships with Islamic leaders. The department maintained that such relationships are crucial for countering extremism and promoting stability in regions where radical ideologies can thrive.

Despite the government’s stated intentions, the article suggests that there is a broader concern about the implications of U.S. wealth being redistributed to Islamist groups. This raises questions about the potential impact on U.S. demographics and politics, particularly in light of the ongoing influx of Muslim refugees into the country. Critics argue that the combination of these factors could lead to significant changes in the social and political landscape of the United States.

As the debate continues, taxpayer advocates are calling for a re-evaluation of spending priorities, urging lawmakers to focus on domestic issues that directly affect the lives of American citizens. The sentiment among many is that taxpayer dollars should be utilized to address pressing concerns at home rather than being directed toward foreign religious institutions.

The resurfacing of this story serves as a reminder of the contentious nature of government spending and the importance of transparency in how taxpayer money is allocated. With significant portions of the population still grappling with economic hardship, the question of prioritizing domestic needs over foreign initiatives remains a critical point of contention.

As discussions around the funding of overseas mosque renovations gain traction, it is clear that the legacy of the Obama administration continues to be a polarizing topic. The implications of such spending decisions will likely resonate in political discourse for years to come, as citizens demand accountability and a focus on the challenges facing Americans today.",-13.0,-4.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,623.0,-0.18181818181818182,-0.006420545746388443

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

In a bold response to the ongoing threat posed by ISIS and similar terrorist organizations, the United States Marine Corps has launched a nationwide billboard campaign aimed at instilling confidence and resilience in the face of fear tactics employed by these groups. Terrorist organizations have long relied on fear and propaganda to intimidate individuals into conversion and submission, often labeling those who refuse as infidels and subjecting them to death threats. The Marine Corps seeks to counter this narrative with a message of strength and readiness.

The campaign comes at a time when the United States has witnessed a troubling increase in terrorist attacks, making the timing of the Marines' message particularly significant. By placing billboards across the country, the Marines aim to communicate their unwavering preparedness to confront any terrorist threats that may arise. This proactive stance sends a clear signal: the Marines are unbothered by being on terrorist hit lists and embrace the challenge presented by those who wish to instill fear.

Critics of the campaign, particularly from liberal circles, have voiced their discontent, arguing that the messaging prioritizes American self-defense over what they perceive as a need for terrorist appeasement. However, the Marine Corps remains steadfast in its belief that showcasing readiness is essential to undermining the power of terrorists. By countering the fear that these groups seek to instill, the Marines aim to demonstrate that if individuals are not afraid, terrorists lose their grip on power.

The billboards serve not only as a reminder of the Marines' commitment to protecting American citizens but also as a rallying cry for resilience in the face of adversity. The underlying message is clear: fear should not dictate how individuals live their lives. By standing firm against the threats posed by ISIS and other extremist factions, the Marine Corps is sending a powerful message of defiance.

As the campaign unfolds, the Marine Corps emphasizes that their presence is not merely a show of force but a commitment to safeguarding the freedoms that Americans hold dear. The billboards encapsulate a spirit of determination, urging citizens to remain vigilant and united against the threats of terrorism.

In conclusion, the Marine Corps' billboard campaign represents a significant step in the ongoing battle against terrorism. By declaring ""Game over"" to ISIS and similar groups, the Marines are not only challenging the narratives of fear but also reaffirming their role as defenders of liberty and security in an increasingly complex global landscape. The message is simple: the Marines are ready, and they will not back down in the face of terror.",-53.0,-27.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,480.0,-1.588235294117647,-0.05625

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has been engulfed in chaos as rioting has severely impacted the city, leading to widespread violence, looting, and destruction. Reports indicate that numerous businesses have been targeted, with incidents of arson and even murder contributing to the escalating crisis. In response to the unrest, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency, taking decisive action by deploying the National Guard to help restore order in the beleaguered city.

The violence has prompted officials to implement strict measures aimed at curbing the unrest. Individuals caught rioting, looting, or engaging in acts of violence will face severe consequences, including the permanent revocation of their government benefits. This policy extends to minor children involved in such activities, with ramifications that could affect their parents as well. Parents of minors who are found participating in the riots may not only lose state benefits but could also be referred to social services, potentially leading to the loss of custody of their children.

City official Wilson Stewart stressed the importance of parental responsibility during these turbulent times, urging parents to take an active role in monitoring their children's activities. ""We must hold ourselves accountable as a community,"" Stewart stated, highlighting the need for families to engage in discussions about the consequences of such actions. The message is clear: the city is taking a hard stance against those who contribute to the violence, and parents must be vigilant in guiding their children away from harmful behaviors.

In an effort to restore peace, a mandatory curfew has been instituted, restricting movement during certain hours to minimize the potential for further chaos. The curfew aims to deter individuals from engaging in unlawful activities and to provide a sense of safety for residents. However, the effectiveness of these measures in preventing future violence remains uncertain, as the community grapples with the aftermath of the recent upheaval.

As Charlotte continues to face the repercussions of the riots, the city is left to ponder the long-term implications of these events. The combination of violence, property destruction, and the potential loss of government benefits for families raises questions about the social fabric of the community. With tensions running high, officials are tasked with finding a balance between enforcing the law and addressing the underlying issues that may have contributed to the unrest.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of peace in urban environments, and the need for comprehensive strategies to address not only the immediate violence but also the root causes that lead to such upheaval. As the National Guard works alongside local law enforcement to restore order, the hope is that the city can emerge from this crisis stronger and more united, with a renewed commitment to fostering a safe and supportive community for all its residents.",-33.0,-25.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,534.0,-1.3888888888888888,-0.04681647940074907

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

FBI Director James Comey is under increasing scrutiny and pressure to resign as criticism mounts regarding his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal. The controversy has intensified following revelations that Comey granted immunity to several of Clinton's top aides, including her Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills. This decision has raised eyebrows, particularly given Mills' lack of cooperation in the investigation, including her refusal to provide her computer for examination.

The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th to assess Comey's actions and determine his future in the role. The committee's inquiry reflects growing concerns among lawmakers about the integrity of the investigation and Comey's judgment in managing such a high-profile case.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has emerged as a vocal critic of Comey, openly calling for his resignation. DiGenova has questioned Comey's fitness for office, arguing that the investigation into Clinton's email practices has been inadequate. He contends that a grand jury should have been convened and a subpoena issued for Mills' computer, asserting that the current investigation has been merely a ""protected investigation"" that lacks the rigor expected in such significant matters.

The fallout from Comey's decisions has led Congress to issue a subpoena for documents related to the Clinton email scandal, a request that Comey has repeatedly failed to fulfill. This lack of compliance has further fueled the perception that Comey's actions may be influenced by loyalties that compromise the integrity of the FBI.

As the investigation progresses, questions surrounding Comey's loyalty to Clinton have emerged, prompting speculation about the potential consequences he may face for his actions. The ongoing scrutiny has placed Comey in a precarious position, as he navigates the complex political landscape surrounding the Clinton email investigation.

With the House Judiciary Committee's hearing approaching, the pressure on Comey is expected to escalate. Lawmakers are eager to understand the rationale behind his decisions, particularly the immunity granted to Mills and other aides, and the implications these choices have for the investigation's credibility.

As public interest in the Clinton email scandal continues to grow, the implications of Comey's actions may extend beyond the immediate investigation, potentially impacting the broader perception of the FBI's independence and integrity. The outcome of the upcoming hearing could determine not only Comey's fate but also the future direction of the investigation itself.

In a climate rife with political tension and scrutiny, the stakes are high for Comey, as he faces a critical moment in his tenure as FBI Director. The coming weeks will be pivotal in shaping the narrative surrounding the Clinton email investigation and the role of the FBI in addressing such significant issues of national interest.",-17.0,-5.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,513.0,-0.2777777777777778,-0.009746588693957114

Recent allegations have surfaced implicating Saudi Arabia, a significant donor to Hillary Clinton’s political campaign, in the horrific practice of selling ISIS sex slaves at public auctions. These revelations have reignited discussions about the United States' longstanding relationship with the kingdom, especially in light of the troubling history surrounding terrorism and human rights abuses.

The majority of the terrorists involved in the September 11 attacks were found to have originated from Saudi Arabia, raising serious concerns about the nation’s role in global terrorism and the appropriateness of U.S. support for the country. Critics argue that accepting financial contributions from nations that are perceived to oppose U.S. interests, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, is not only unethical but also detrimental to American values and security.

Reports have emerged detailing the trafficking of women, particularly Yazidi girls, who have become victims of this brutal market. These women are allegedly being sold at auctions attended by a mix of buyers, including Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis, and Westerners. The Islamic State has established a notorious reputation for the abuse and trafficking of women, with a particular focus on non-Muslim women, who are often subjected to enslavement in the most harrowing conditions.

Disturbingly, accounts from those who have been rescued from ISIS captivity suggest that many women are not being granted the freedom they deserve. Instead, they are reportedly being sold into further exploitation, perpetuating a cycle of abuse that is both appalling and unacceptable. This ongoing situation has prompted calls for a reevaluation of the U.S.'s political ties with Saudi Arabia, as well as an immediate cessation of weapons sales to the kingdom.

The allegations against Saudi Arabia have been compounded by claims that both Saudi Arabia and Russia may be sponsoring ISIS. This revelation has raised alarm bells among U.S. leadership, prompting a demand for accountability and a thorough investigation into the extent of these nations' involvement in supporting terrorist activities. The implications of such sponsorship are profound, as they not only threaten regional stability but also endanger American lives.

Critics of the U.S. government’s current foreign policy argue that it is imperative to reassess relationships with countries that engage in or support activities contrary to American interests and values. The ongoing trafficking of women and the exploitation of vulnerable populations highlight the urgent need for a more principled approach to foreign aid and military partnerships. Advocates for change are calling for a comprehensive review of how U.S. foreign aid is allocated and to whom it is given, particularly in light of the troubling human rights records of certain nations.

As the situation unfolds, the international community watches closely, hoping for a shift in policy that prioritizes human rights and the protection of the most vulnerable. The plight of women caught in the crossfire of war and terrorism should serve as a wake-up call for policymakers and citizens alike. It is essential to hold accountable those who facilitate such atrocities and to ensure that U.S. foreign policy aligns with the values of justice and human dignity.

In conclusion, the allegations against Saudi Arabia regarding the sale of ISIS sex slaves and the broader implications for U.S. foreign policy cannot be ignored. This situation demands urgent attention and action from American leadership, as the consequences of inaction could reverberate throughout the region and beyond. The time has come to confront uncomfortable truths and to forge a path toward a more ethical and responsible foreign policy that prioritizes the protection of human rights over financial gain.",-30.0,-35.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,668.0,-1.5909090909090908,-0.05239520958083832
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate of the 2016 election cycle showcased a fierce exchange of ideas and accusations between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump. The event, moderated by NBC's Lester Holt, was marked by moments of tension and controversy, particularly in the way the candidates were questioned.

As the debate unfolded, Holt faced criticism for his approach, particularly for his decision to interrupt Trump to fact-check his statements. Some of these fact-checks were later deemed inaccurate, raising concerns about the moderator's impartiality. One of the most contentious moments occurred when Holt pressed Trump on his alleged support for the Iraq War. Trump vehemently denied ever endorsing the invasion, but Holt continued to challenge him on the issue.

In a notable contrast, Holt did not question Clinton about her own vote in favor of the war, instead focusing solely on Trump's position. This led to frustrations among Trump's supporters, who felt that the line of questioning was biased. Holt referenced a past interview in which Trump expressed reservations about the invasion of Iraq, suggesting that President Bush should have waited for input from the United Nations before taking military action. However, the insistence on Trump's stance on the war overshadowed Clinton's own history with the issue.

Critics of the mainstream media have pointed to this debate as an example of an ongoing effort to undermine Trump. The narrative that emerged from the debate suggested a coordinated attempt to challenge the Republican nominee at every turn, which many supporters interpreted as an unfair tactic designed to weaken his campaign.

Despite these challenges, Trump demonstrated resilience throughout the debate, maintaining his position against both Clinton and the media's scrutiny. His ability to stand firm in the face of direct questioning and interruptions highlighted his determination to present his case to the American public. 

The debate not only set the tone for the campaign ahead but also ignited discussions about media bias and the role of moderators in political discourse. As the election approaches, the dynamics established in this debate are likely to influence voter perceptions and the strategies employed by both candidates.

In summary, the first presidential debate was characterized by intense exchanges, a controversial moderation style, and significant implications for the upcoming election. As both candidates prepare for future debates, the issues raised during this encounter will remain at the forefront of the political conversation.",-9.0,-23.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,455.0,-1.2777777777777777,-0.05054945054945055
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

The Birther movement, which emerged prominently during Barack Obama's presidency, has sparked intense discussions regarding its implications on racism and the question of Obama's citizenship. Central to this movement are claims that have been largely discredited, yet they continue to resonate with certain segments of the population.

In 2004, a Breitbart article made headlines, alleging that Obama was ""Kenyan-born"" as he prepared to enter the U.S. Senate race. This claim gained traction, particularly as Obama established a significant lead in the race following the withdrawal of his rival, Jack Ryan, who stepped down due to a scandal. The timing of these allegations raises questions about the motivations behind them and their potential connection to the racial dynamics at play in American politics.

The article in question suggests that Obama never explicitly refuted the assertion of being Kenyan-born, leaving room for doubt in the minds of some voters. This notion was further fueled by a 1991 promotional booklet from Obama's literary agency, which described him as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” This booklet, circulated among publishing industry colleagues, included a biography alongside those of other authors, inadvertently contributing to the narrative that questioned Obama's American birth and citizenship.

The implications of these claims are profound, as they not only challenge the legitimacy of Obama's identity but also suggest a potential manipulation of his background for personal gain. This narrative has been utilized by opponents to undermine his presidency and question his integrity, raising broader concerns about how race and identity are weaponized in political discourse.

The Birther movement has often been characterized as a manifestation of deeper societal issues, particularly racism. The relentless questioning of Obama's citizenship can be seen as a reflection of the discomfort some Americans have with a Black president, and the movement itself has been criticized for perpetuating racial stereotypes and xenophobia.

As the debate continues, the context surrounding these claims remains essential for understanding their impact. The original Breitbart article and subsequent discussions have fueled a narrative that questions the authenticity of Obama's life story, an inquiry that seems to extend beyond mere political rivalry into the realm of racial identity.

In conclusion, the Birther movement serves as a stark reminder of the intersection between race, politics, and personal identity in America. The legacy of Barack Obama, shaped by these allegations, continues to provoke discussions about race and the lengths to which individuals and movements will go to undermine those in power. The implications of these claims are far-reaching, inviting further exploration into the motivations behind them and their lasting effects on American society.",-18.0,-24.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,499.0,-1.5,-0.04809619238476954

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In a recent debate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton exhibited behavior that diverged from her usual performance, prompting observers and social media users to raise eyebrows and speculate about what might have been behind her atypical demeanor. Notably, Clinton refrained from coughing or reaching for water throughout the event, a departure from her past appearances that many found intriguing.

As the debate unfolded, viewers couldn't help but notice a flesh-colored device seemingly present in Clinton's ear. This observation ignited a flurry of theories across social media platforms, with some suggesting that the device could be an earpiece used for receiving assistance during her responses, while others speculated it might simply be a fashion accessory. The debate over the device quickly became a focal point of discussion, drawing attention away from the issues at hand.

In response to the growing speculation, Clinton's campaign firmly denied that she was wearing an earpiece. A spokesperson attributed the appearance of the device to reflections created by the television lights, a claim intended to quell the swirling rumors. However, this denial did little to silence the chatter, as many continued to question the implications of the device's presence.

Adding another layer to the ongoing discourse, an email released by WikiLeaks, which was sent from Clinton to her close aide Huma Abedin, mentioned an earpiece. This revelation further fueled the speculation surrounding Clinton's debate performance and raised questions about her reliance on external assistance during public speaking engagements. Critics seized upon this information, suggesting that it indicated a level of dishonesty or a dependency on others for her communication.

One commentator humorously remarked that Hillary Clinton appears to need help from others to articulate her thoughts effectively, reinforcing the notion that her debate performance may not have been entirely her own. This commentary, while lighthearted, underscored the skepticism surrounding Clinton's candidacy and her ability to engage directly with voters without assistance.

Despite the fervent speculation and the various theories circulating online, the article ultimately acknowledges a significant gap in concrete evidence regarding the earpiece. Observers are left to interpret the situation based on the available information, with many questions lingering about the nature of the device and its implications for Clinton's performance.

As the debate aftermath continues to unfold, it remains clear that the unusual behavior exhibited by Clinton, coupled with the mystery surrounding the device in her ear, has captured the attention of both supporters and detractors alike. The incident serves as a reminder of the intense scrutiny that public figures face, especially during pivotal moments such as debates. With no definitive answers in sight, the conversation is likely to persist as both sides of the political spectrum navigate the implications of this peculiar episode in Clinton's campaign.",-5.0,7.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,519.0,0.3888888888888889,0.01348747591522158
