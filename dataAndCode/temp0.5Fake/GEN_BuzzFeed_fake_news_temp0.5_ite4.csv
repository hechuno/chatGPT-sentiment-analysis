Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Former President Bill Clinton's recent remarks regarding foundation donors seeking favors have ignited a wave of negative headlines, raising questions about the integrity of his philanthropic efforts. The discourse surrounding his comments has drawn parallels to claims made by Donald Trump, suggesting a potential pay-to-play scheme that could undermine Clinton's credibility.

In an interview with NPR, Clinton addressed the implications of his statement, emphasizing that while it is common for friends and allies to request favors, such requests do not guarantee that they will be fulfilled. This clarification comes in the wake of leaked emails that reveal some donors were granted meetings with Clinton. However, it is crucial to note that there is no concrete evidence indicating that any favors were actually exchanged for these meetings, leaving the narrative open to interpretation.

The timing of Clinton's statement is particularly significant, as it coincides with ongoing scrutiny of Trump's charitable foundation. Notably, Trump has not contributed to his own foundation since 2008 and faces accusations of misusing charity funds for personal expenditures. This stark contrast raises questions about the ethical standards of both political figures regarding their respective foundations.

As the investigation into Trump's charitable foundation unfolds, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is leading the charge, exploring potential improprieties associated with the Trump Foundation. This inquiry adds another layer of complexity to the already contentious political landscape, as it highlights the differing approaches to philanthropy between the two former presidents.

Media scrutiny has played a pivotal role in shaping public perception of both Clinton and Trump. A report from Media Matters has pointed out a perceived double standard in how the media covers issues surrounding the two candidates. For instance, coverage of Clinton's health scare, specifically her pneumonia diagnosis, received significantly more attention than the reports detailing Trump's foundation issues. This disparity in media focus raises concerns about bias and its potential impact on the electoral landscape.

Critics argue that the uneven media coverage is detrimental to Clinton's campaign while inadvertently benefiting Trump. The emphasis on Clinton's health issues may serve to distract voters from the ongoing investigation into Trump's charitable practices. As the election approaches, the significance of media portrayal cannot be overstated, as it shapes the narratives that voters engage with.

The implications of this media coverage extend beyond mere headlines; they influence public perception and voter behavior. With the current political climate marked by heightened scrutiny and polarization, both Clinton and Trump must navigate the challenges posed by their respective foundations and the media's portrayal of their actions.

As the election season heats up, Clinton's comments about foundation donors seeking favors will likely continue to be a focal point of discussion. The juxtaposition of his philanthropic efforts against the backdrop of Trump's charitable controversies presents a complex narrative that voters will need to consider. The ongoing investigations and media coverage will undoubtedly shape the discourse leading up to the election, as both candidates strive to position themselves favorably in the eyes of the electorate.

In conclusion, Bill Clinton's recent statements have opened the door to renewed scrutiny of his foundation and its interactions with donors. As the narrative unfolds, the contrasting approaches to philanthropy between Clinton and Trump will likely remain a significant topic of discussion. The role of media coverage in shaping these narratives cannot be overlooked, as it has the power to influence public perception and, ultimately, the outcome of the election. As both candidates grapple with their respective challenges, the focus on their foundations will remain a critical element of the political landscape in the months ahead.",6.0,14.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,677.0,0.5384615384615384,0.0206794682422452
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A draft congressional report has raised serious allegations against former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), claiming that they distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa. This practice, the report asserts, may have significantly increased the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients relying on these medications for their treatment.

The report, titled ""The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,"" was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, who has been vocal about her concerns regarding the practices of the Clinton Foundation and its initiatives. CHAI is recognized as one of the most significant efforts under the Clinton Foundation, aimed at providing support and access to treatment for AIDS victims in developing countries.

A central focus of the report is the relationship between Clinton and Ranbaxy, an Indian drug manufacturer that has faced scrutiny and controversy regarding its production practices. Ranbaxy supplied HIV/AIDS medications to various developing countries, including those in sub-Saharan Africa, where the need for effective treatments is critical. The report suggests that the quality of these medications may not have met the necessary standards, raising alarms about the potential health implications for patients.

Dinesh Thakur, a former employee of Ranbaxy and a whistleblower, has played a pivotal role in bringing these issues to light. Thakur's revelations about the company's practices led to a landmark lawsuit by the U.S. government against Ranbaxy. In 2013, the company pleaded guilty to multiple criminal counts related to drug adulteration and was subsequently fined $500 million. The Department of Justice noted that the diluted drugs produced by Ranbaxy posed increased risks to patients, particularly those suffering from HIV/AIDS, which raises significant concerns about the efficacy of the treatments provided through CHAI.

Rep. Blackburn has expressed deep concern over the potential loss of lives due to the distribution of substandard drugs by CHAI. The report highlights the serious implications of these allegations, suggesting that the decisions made by Clinton and his team may have had devastating consequences for countless individuals relying on effective medication to manage their health. Blackburn's investigation scrutinizes the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, especially in light of known quality control problems that had previously been flagged by regulatory agencies.

While the report does not specify how many patients may have received the diluted drugs, it emphasizes that substantial U.S. funding was allocated to Ranbaxy during the period in question. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had previously issued warnings to Ranbaxy regarding irregularities in drug potency and quality control, further complicating the narrative surrounding the company's practices. Despite these warnings, CHAI continued to endorse and distribute Ranbaxy's drugs, with Bill Clinton himself praising the company in 2013.

Thakur, who has since transitioned to a public health activist role, criticized the lack of response from CHAI and the Clinton Foundation regarding his concerns about the quality of the drugs being distributed. His whistleblowing efforts were aimed at ensuring that patients received safe and effective medications, yet he has expressed disappointment at what he perceives as a failure to address these critical issues adequately.

Although CHAI separated from the Clinton Foundation in 2010, the report indicates that there are still overlapping board members and close operational ties between the two entities. This connection raises further questions about the oversight and accountability of CHAI's actions and decisions in the distribution of HIV/AIDS medications.

The report also suggests that Bill Clinton may have relaxed quality standards for HIV/AIDS medications through an executive order issued in 2000. This decision, if substantiated, could have far-reaching implications for the safety and efficacy of the drugs distributed under the CHAI initiative. CHAI began distributing generic HIV drugs from several foreign manufacturers, including Ranbaxy, in 2003, which further complicates the timeline of events and the potential impact on patient health.

Additionally, the congressional study highlights concerns regarding potential corruption and financial benefits to the Clinton Foundation stemming from relationships with certain Indian-American businessmen. Rep. Blackburn emphasized the emotional toll that these allegations may have on healthcare workers and patients, many of whom may have been misled by the false hopes created by the Clinton Foundation's initiatives.

As the report continues to circulate, it raises critical questions about the accountability of philanthropic organizations and the ethical implications of their partnerships with pharmaceutical companies. The potential ramifications for public health, particularly in regions heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, are profound, and the need for transparency and rigorous quality control in drug distribution has never been more urgent.

The allegations outlined in the report serve as a stark reminder of the complexities involved in global health initiatives and the importance of ensuring that vulnerable populations receive safe and effective treatments. As investigations into these claims unfold, the spotlight remains on the Clinton Foundation, CHAI, and the broader implications for public health policy and drug distribution practices.

The report's findings have sparked a renewed debate about the role of former political leaders in philanthropic efforts, particularly when those efforts intersect with the healthcare needs of millions. The potential consequences of distributing substandard medications cannot be understated, and the call for accountability and reform in the pharmaceutical industry grows louder.

As this situation develops, it is essential for stakeholders, including healthcare providers, policymakers, and the public, to remain vigilant and informed about the integrity of health initiatives aimed at combating diseases like HIV/AIDS. The health and well-being of countless individuals depend on the effectiveness and safety of the medications they receive, and the implications of the congressional report could have lasting effects on how such initiatives are structured and monitored in the future.

In conclusion, the draft congressional report alleging that Bill Clinton and CHAI distributed diluted HIV/AIDS drugs raises significant concerns about the quality of care provided to vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa. With ongoing scrutiny from lawmakers and public health advocates alike, the need for transparency, accountability, and rigorous standards in drug distribution remains paramount. As the investigation continues, the focus will undoubtedly remain on the implications for public health and the ethical responsibilities of philanthropic organizations in their quest to provide aid and support to those in need.",-6.0,20.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,1141.0,0.5405405405405406,0.017528483786152498
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a shocking turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van following a 9/11 ceremony in New York City. This incident has sparked a wave of speculation regarding her health and public appearances leading up to the upcoming election.

Shortly after her collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment, but observers noted a striking transformation in her appearance. Those who caught a glimpse described her as looking noticeably different—lighter, more vibrant, and with a new nose that has been characterized as Roman-type. This change is particularly pronounced when compared to the former First Lady's previously recognized Nordic nose.

Adding to the intrigue, the stand-in for Clinton appears younger and notably lacks a mole that has long been associated with the real Hillary above her right lip. This absence has raised eyebrows and led to further questions about the authenticity of the individual representing Clinton in public settings.

As speculation mounts, some analysts suggest that this new figure may be positioned to handle most of Clinton's public appearances in the lead-up to the election, particularly due to ongoing concerns about her health. Observers are voicing apprehensions about Clinton's ability to participate in upcoming debates, especially against her political rival, Donald Trump.

Several signs have been identified to help distinguish the clone from the real Hillary Clinton. These include significant weight loss, a youthful appearance, and the absence of health issues that have previously plagued the former Secretary of State, such as coughing fits. The implications of these changes have raised critical questions about the future of Clinton's political engagement.

There is growing concern among voters and political analysts alike regarding whether the real Hillary Clinton will be seen or heard at all if she is elected. The possibility that the clone may manage public engagements has led to fears of a lack of genuine leadership. This speculation raises fundamental questions about the nature of representation in American politics, particularly in light of the potential for a Clinton Administration run entirely by a figure that may not be the actual Hillary Clinton.

The situation has drawn comparisons to past skepticism surrounding President Obama, where doubts regarding his authenticity and leadership were similarly discussed. This trend of questioning the true identity and involvement of political figures in the U.S. has become increasingly prevalent, as citizens grapple with the implications of leadership that may not be as transparent as it once seemed.

As the election approaches, the discourse surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and her potential clone continues to evolve. The views expressed in this article represent the author's perspective and are not necessarily endorsed by EagleRising.com. However, the implications of this narrative are significant, as they challenge the very essence of political engagement and the authenticity of public figures.

In a political landscape already fraught with division and skepticism, the emergence of a potential clone raises more questions than answers. Will voters be able to trust the representation they see on stage? How will this affect the dynamics of the election? And ultimately, what does it mean for the future of leadership in the United States?

As the situation develops, it remains to be seen how Clinton's health will influence her campaign strategy and public presence. The upcoming debates, particularly against Donald Trump, will be critical in determining whether the real Hillary Clinton or her stand-in will take center stage. The American public is left to ponder the implications of this evolving narrative as the election draws near, marking a new chapter in the complex interplay of health, identity, and politics. 

In the face of uncertainty, one thing is clear: the upcoming months will be pivotal for Hillary Clinton, her campaign, and the broader implications for American democracy.",8.0,2.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,705.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0028368794326241137
Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

In a climate of heightened political tension, former President Donald Trump has made a series of controversial statements regarding immigration and national security that have sparked widespread concern among civil rights advocates and community leaders. His proposals, which some critics label as extreme, suggest a significant shift in the U.S. approach to immigration and the treatment of Muslim communities.

One of Trump's most notable proposals is the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which he claims is necessary to prevent the entry of ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers."" This rhetoric has been criticized for its dehumanizing portrayal of immigrants and has raised questions about the implications of such a stance for U.S. immigration policy. The wall, which Trump has touted as a solution to crime and drug trafficking, has become a symbol of his hardline approach to immigration.

In addition to the wall, Trump has endorsed the idea of creating a national registry for Muslims, suggesting that they should wear special identification badges. This proposal has drawn parallels to historical instances of discrimination and persecution, prompting fears of a return to practices that could marginalize entire communities. Critics argue that such measures could lead to an environment of fear and mistrust among American Muslims, undermining the principles of equality and freedom that the country is built upon.

Trump's rhetoric extends beyond immigration policy; he has also advocated for targeting the families of terrorists, stating that they should be ""taken out."" This statement has raised alarms about the potential for collective punishment, which is widely considered a violation of human rights. The implications of such a policy could be devastating, leading to increased violence and suffering among innocent families.

Amidst these controversial proposals, Trump's Senior Communications Advisor has stated that the former president is focused on challenging the ""narratives"" of President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, rather than addressing terrorism itself. This suggests a shift in focus away from combating actual threats and towards a political agenda that seeks to undermine the previous administration's policies.

Trump has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the Obama administration, claiming it has allowed immigrants from dangerous countries to gain U.S. citizenship. He has also accused Hillary Clinton of exacerbating the risk of terrorist attacks by supporting an increase in Syrian refugees. Trump's assertions that radical Islamic terrorism has proliferated under the policies of Obama and Clinton reflect a broader narrative that seeks to link immigration with national security threats.

In his calls for action, Trump has expressed a belief that Muslims should actively report suspicious individuals within their communities. While the intention behind this statement may be to promote vigilance, it raises concerns about the potential stigmatization of Muslims and the pressure it places on community members to act as informants. This expectation could foster an atmosphere of suspicion and division, further alienating Muslim Americans.

As these discussions unfold, there are growing concerns about how Trump might define terrorism and the potential ramifications for Muslim communities in America. The ambiguity surrounding his statements raises questions about who would be classified as a terrorist and how this classification could lead to discrimination or unjust treatment of individuals based on their faith or ethnicity.

The implications of Trump's presidency are troubling for many, with warnings about the possible revival of concentration camps and violence against civilians. Such fears are rooted in historical precedents where marginalized groups faced persecution during times of political upheaval. The rhetoric employed by Trump has the potential to incite division and hostility, which could lead to dangerous outcomes for vulnerable populations.

In light of these developments, the importance of civic engagement and voting has never been more pronounced. Advocates for civil rights and social justice emphasize the need for individuals to participate in the electoral process to prevent Trump from taking office. They argue that the stakes are too high, and the potential consequences of his presidency could have lasting impacts on the fabric of American society.

As the nation approaches the next election, it is crucial for voters to consider the implications of their choices. The dialogue surrounding immigration, national security, and civil rights is more than just a political debate; it encompasses the values of inclusivity, justice, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background.

In conclusion, the controversial statements and proposals put forth by Donald Trump regarding immigrants and Muslims have ignited a significant debate about the future of U.S. immigration policy and the treatment of marginalized communities.

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama addressed the United Nations, discussing the concept of a One World Government and globalization.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Recent allegations have emerged regarding potential pay-to-play corruption involving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. Critics claim that donors to the foundation gained undue political access, including coveted invitations to White House State dinners, raising questions about the integrity of the foundation’s operations.

In response to these accusations, the Clinton campaign has vigorously defended the foundation, emphasizing its charitable work and the positive impact it has had on various global issues. However, detractors argue that the Clinton Foundation primarily functions as a financial vehicle for the Clintons and their associates, casting doubt on the legitimacy of its charitable endeavors.

Financial scrutiny of the foundation reveals troubling statistics. According to IRS filings, a mere 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation's budget in 2014 was allocated to charitable grants. Out of a total spending of nearly $91.3 million that year, less than $5.2 million was directed towards charitable initiatives. This raises significant concerns about the foundation's commitment to its stated mission of philanthropy.

Moreover, the foundation's expenditures on salaries, compensation, and employee benefits reached $34.8 million, while an additional $50.4 million was spent on ""other expenses."" Alarmingly, the foundation's charitable spending saw a decrease of 40% from 2013 to 2014, despite an increase of $30 million in revenue during the same period. This decline in charitable contributions, alongside the rise in administrative costs, has led to heightened scrutiny of the foundation's priorities.

The increase in salaries and benefits by $5 million in 2014, coupled with the surge in ""other expenses,"" further complicates the narrative surrounding the foundation’s financial practices. Critics argue that these trends suggest a shift away from the foundation’s purported charitable mission towards a focus on generating wealth for the Clintons and their network.

As the allegations of corruption continue to circulate, the conclusion drawn by many is stark: the Clinton Foundation may have primarily served as a means for the Clintons to generate wealth, with Hillary Clinton leveraging her position as Secretary of State for financial gain. The ongoing debate over the foundation's operations raises critical questions about accountability and transparency in philanthropic organizations, particularly those with high-profile political connections.",25.0,16.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,426.0,1.0666666666666667,0.03755868544600939

NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

During that event, Clinton was seen convulsing and required assistance to enter her van, prompting widespread concern and speculation.

Initially, Clinton's campaign attributed the episode to the heat, despite the fact that the weather in New York City that day was a mild 74 degrees. Following the incident, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment, passing several hospitals along the way, which raised eyebrows and fueled further questions about her health.

As Clinton addressed supporters in Greensboro, doubts emerged regarding the authenticity of her recovery and the nature of the rally itself. Observers noted peculiarities in a video from the event that led to suspicions about the audience's legitimacy. Viewers questioned the positioning of cameras, suggesting that the atmosphere may have been manipulated.

Additional videos have circulated online, analyzing the rally footage and proposing that the audience might have been fabricated. A video from C-Span has been referenced to support claims that earlier videos were not altered, adding to the ongoing debate surrounding the event. As discussions continue, the implications of Clinton's health and the authenticity of her public appearances remain a focal point for both supporters and critics alike.",4.0,-1.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,252.0,-0.1,-0.003968253968253968
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the release date approaches for the fictional film ""Weekend at Chelsea's,"" audiences are abuzz with anticipation. This satirical take on Hillary Clinton’s media portrayal is not just a comedic endeavor; it reflects a deeper societal discourse surrounding the former Secretary of State's health and the mainstream media's unwavering support for her.

Critics have long pointed to a perceived bias in the media, suggesting that the coverage surrounding Clinton has often downplayed serious health issues that may affect her public image and political viability. Allegations have surfaced claiming that Clinton is severely ill, with various health incidents raising eyebrows. Observers note the frequent presence of a personal physician by her side, leading to speculation about the true state of her health. This has fueled a narrative that questions the transparency of her medical history.

Among the most alarming claims are allegations of cover-ups regarding Clinton's health. Notably, her past experience with a brain blood clot has been cited as a significant concern. Critics argue that such incidents warrant closer scrutiny, especially given the high stakes of her political ambitions. The film ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" seems to tap into this sentiment, offering a fictional lens through which audiences can explore the implications of these health controversies.

Adding to the intrigue are the blue-tinted glasses that Clinton has been known to wear, which some speculate are associated with seizure disorders and Parkinson's disease. The suggestion that she may suffer from such conditions raises further questions about her fitness for the presidency. Critics argue that the media's reluctance to address these issues head-on reinforces doubts about her ability to lead effectively.

As Clinton's poll numbers continue to decline, the recent fallout from a controversial statement regarding Trump supporters has only exacerbated her challenges. This statement has not only alienated segments of the electorate but has also sparked renewed scrutiny of her credibility. Critics have revisited her past associations and statements, particularly concerning issues of race, questioning whether her actions align with her rhetoric. This ongoing critique has contributed to a broader narrative that paints Clinton as an increasingly polarizing figure.

Despite these challenges, there exists a complex emotional landscape surrounding Clinton's struggles. Many express mixed feelings about her situation, grappling with compassion for her health issues while simultaneously critiquing her political maneuvers. This duality reflects a broader societal struggle to reconcile personal empathy with political accountability.

As the film ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" approaches its premiere, speculation abounds regarding Clinton's potential to still win the election, despite the health concerns and media support that have surrounded her. The narrative within the film may serve as a microcosm for the larger political landscape, where personal health and public perception intertwine in unpredictable ways.

While some hope for Clinton's political decline, wishing for her well-being in her private life, others remain invested in the outcome of her political career. The film promises to explore these themes with a satirical edge, inviting audiences to reflect on the complexities of political life in the public eye.

As anticipation builds for ""Weekend at Chelsea's,"" the film stands as a commentary on the intersection of health, media, and politics, offering a unique perspective on one of the most scrutinized figures in American political history. Whether it serves as a vehicle for humor or a platform for serious reflection, the film is poised to spark conversation about the implications of health and honesty in the realm of public service.",-18.0,-6.0,1165.0,-0.375,-0.015450643776824034,670.0,-0.23076923076923078,-0.008955223880597015

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a poignant final address to the United Nations Assembly, former President Barack Obama articulated his skepticism regarding the prospects of defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist factions. During his speech, he underscored the limitations of military power in addressing these complex threats, famously referring to ISIS as a ""JV team,"" a term that has since sparked considerable debate about the seriousness of the threat posed by such groups.

Obama's remarks highlighted a stark reality: the United States, often viewed as a global police force, faces insurmountable challenges in combating the rise of extremism. He pointed to the significant growth of the Islamic State and indicated that a viable military solution to this issue remains elusive. ""We have no chance of winning the battle against extremism through military means alone,"" he stated, emphasizing the need for a multifaceted approach to this global crisis.

Central to Obama’s message was the importance of understanding the nature of the conflicts at hand. He argued that a comprehensive strategy must include diplomacy, as well as efforts to halt violence, deliver humanitarian aid, and support political settlements that respect the diverse communities affected by extremism. This call for a diplomatic approach reflects a broader understanding that the roots of extremism are often deeply embedded in political, social, and economic grievances.

However, the address also contained a critical tone toward what some perceive as a reluctance to acknowledge the connection between radical Islam and violence. The article accompanying his speech argued that failing to recognize this link has significantly contributed to the current predicament. It posited that a lack of decisive action in addressing the threat of radical Islam could lead to dire consequences, both for the United States and for the international community.

The former president's address serves as a reminder of the complexities involved in combating extremism. While military interventions have been a prominent aspect of U.S. foreign policy, Obama’s emphasis on diplomacy and understanding suggests a shift toward a more nuanced approach. He called for a concerted effort to engage with communities at risk of radicalization, fostering dialogue and cooperation rather than relying solely on force.

As the world grapples with the ongoing threat of terrorism, Obama’s final address at the U.N. serves as both a reflection on past strategies and a call to action for future efforts. The acknowledgment of the limitations of military power and the advocacy for a more assertive and comprehensive response to radical Islam underscores the urgent need for a united global effort to combat extremism.

In conclusion, Obama’s parting words at the U.N. Assembly resonate with the pressing challenges facing the international community. His call for understanding, diplomacy, and proactive measures to address the roots of extremism highlights the complexities of modern conflicts and the necessity of a multifaceted response to ensure lasting peace and security.",-5.0,-3.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,547.0,-0.15,-0.005484460694698354
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents have shed light on the CIA and DIA's knowledge of the Islamic State's emergence as early as 2012. The revelations suggest that the Obama Administration may have inadvertently fostered conditions that allowed ISIS to thrive, particularly through actions that isolated the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad.

The documents forecasted that support from Western nations, Turkey, and Gulf states for Takfiri militants would pave the way for the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. Investigative journalist Nafeez Ahmed has pointed out that this strategy was aimed at destabilizing Assad's regime, despite the significant risk of giving rise to a more extremist group like the Islamic State.

The analysis of the documents has led to a reassessment of former President Obama's portrayal of ISIS as a ""JV"" team. Critics argue that this characterization, along with the decision not to maintain a residual military presence in Iraq, represents serious miscalculations that contributed to the group's rapid expansion.

In addition to insights on ISIS, the documents also delve into U.S. weapons operations in Libya leading up to the 2012 Benghazi attack. They reveal that American intelligence was aware of arms being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports, raising questions about the implications of U.S. involvement in the region.

The report further suggests that American servicemen, as well as those stationed in Benghazi, were sacrificed as a result of a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that prioritized political maneuvering over national security. This has led to significant criticism of the administration for allegedly concealing crucial facts that could have informed better decision-making.

As the U.S. grapples with the long-term consequences of its foreign policy in the Middle East, these revelations serve as a stark reminder of the complex interplay between international support for rebel groups and the unintended emergence of extremist organizations like ISIS. The ongoing debate over the efficacy and morality of such strategies continues to shape discussions on national security and foreign policy in the region.",-27.0,0.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,377.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van following the 9-11 memorial ceremony in New York City. The incident raised immediate concerns about her health and the implications it may have for her public engagements leading up to the upcoming election.

Shortly after the incident, Clinton made a surprising appearance at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment. Observers noted a significant transformation in her demeanor; she appeared more energetic and lighter than in previous public appearances. However, what caught the attention of many was an observable change in her facial features. Some observers remarked on the alteration in the shape of her nose, suggesting a resemblance to a ""clone"" with a Roman-type nose, contrasting sharply with Hillary's traditionally Nordic nose.

This unexpected change in appearance has fueled rampant speculation about the authenticity of the individual seen in Chelsea's apartment. Notably, the clone appeared younger and was devoid of the distinctive mole above the lip that has long been associated with the real Hillary Clinton. This has led to questions about whether the clone would assume a more prominent role in public appearances, particularly as the election season intensifies.

Concerns are mounting regarding Hillary Clinton's ability to participate in the upcoming debates against Donald Trump. Observers are urged to pay attention to signs that may indicate differences in her appearance, such as signs of weight fluctuation, youthfulness, and the absence of visible health issues that have previously plagued her. The implications of these changes are significant, as they raise doubts about Hillary's capacity to fulfill her duties as a candidate.

The speculation extends beyond her physical health; it raises profound questions about the nature of her leadership. If the clone is indeed to take over most public duties, what does that mean for the governance of a potential Clinton Administration? Would the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen in a presidential role again, or would her clone be tasked with handling all public responsibilities?

The prospect of a Clinton Administration operated without Hillary's direct involvement evokes comparisons to previous administrations, particularly that of President Obama. Critics have suggested that such a scenario could lead to a lack of transparency in leadership, echoing concerns that have been voiced throughout Obama's presidency. The implications of this potential governance model are troubling for many, who worry about the accountability and authenticity of leadership in the highest office.

As the election approaches, the political landscape is becoming increasingly fraught with uncertainty. The emergence of a ""clone"" has not only raised eyebrows but has also sparked a conversation about the nature of identity and representation in politics. The public's trust in their leaders is paramount, and questions surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and the possibility of a surrogate leader could have lasting repercussions on her campaign.

While the views expressed herein are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the stance of EagleRising.com, it is clear that the situation warrants close attention. The implications of Clinton's health and the potential for a clone to take her place in public life are not just matters of personal concern; they touch upon the very essence of democratic representation and the integrity of the electoral process.

As the nation watches, the unfolding narrative surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and her potential clone raises critical questions about the future of political leadership. Will the public accept a candidate who may not be the real Hillary Clinton, or will this speculation lead to a deeper inquiry into the authenticity of political figures? The coming weeks will undoubtedly be pivotal as the election approaches, and the answers to these questions may shape the future of American politics.",8.0,10.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,695.0,0.38461538461538464,0.014388489208633094
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Recent rumors have sparked concern regarding Hillary Clinton's mental and physical health, with speculation suggesting she may be experiencing a nervous breakdown. This speculation intensified after a recent video surfaced showing Clinton struggling with eye control, which ultimately led to the cancellation of a planned fundraiser in North Carolina.

Clinton's campaign schedule has raised eyebrows as well. Between September 20 and October 19, Clinton has only one scheduled rally event, a stark contrast to former President Donald Trump, who has four rallies planned during the same period. This disparity has fueled further concerns about Clinton's ability to maintain a vigorous campaign schedule.

Health-related worries have been compounded by incidents that have raised questions about Clinton's well-being. One notable event involved her requiring Secret Service assistance to navigate two steps, prompting discussions about her overall health status. As these concerns mount, predictions suggest that Clinton may not be able to conceal her health issues for much longer.

In light of these developments, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly exploring potential replacements for Clinton. This situation is complicated by the apparent reluctance of Bernie Sanders to enter the presidential race, leaving the DNC in a challenging position as they seek viable alternatives.

Despite past emails indicating that Clinton has been positioned as the leading choice by the DNC, the current climate has led to increased scrutiny of the nomination process. The notion of a predetermined nomination has raised eyebrows among party members and the public alike, as speculation continues to swirl about Clinton's health and its implications for her candidacy.

As the situation unfolds, many observers are questioning how long the truth about Clinton's health can remain under wraps. There are concerns that if the reality of her condition comes to light, it could have damaging repercussions for the Democratic Party's reputation and electoral prospects.

In a time when the political landscape is rapidly evolving, the DNC's handling of Clinton's candidacy and health issues will be closely watched. The outcome of this situation could significantly influence the party's direction as it heads toward the next election cycle. With uncertainty surrounding Clinton's viability as a candidate, the DNC faces a critical juncture in its quest to maintain a united front leading up to the election.",-8.0,0.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,432.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In a startling revelation that combines elements of fantasy and political intrigue, former President Barack Obama’s late-night wanderings in the White House have taken on a new significance. The events that transpired during a sleepless night have been recounted in a series of bizarre and unexpected developments that would eventually lead to the conceptualization of an organization that would capture global attention: ISIS.

It was a restless night in the White House when Obama found himself grappling with insomnia. The stillness of the West Wing offered little comfort, and as the hours ticked by, he felt an inexplicable urge to explore his surroundings. This nocturnal adventure led him on a path that would intertwine his destiny with an idea that would later reverberate throughout the world.

As he wandered through the dimly lit halls, Obama stumbled upon a word that would ignite his imagination: ""ISIS."" The name struck him, and he promptly jotted it down on a Post-It note, unaware of the profound implications this simple act would have in the months to come. This seemingly innocuous moment marked the inception of a thought process that would evolve into something far more complex.

Months later, the vibrant atmosphere of the Coachella music festival served as the backdrop for a significant turning point in Obama’s life. Surrounded by the pulsating energy of the crowd, he found himself reflecting on his earlier musings. The festival, known for its eclectic mix of music and culture, inspired Obama to further develop the notion of ISIS, envisioning it not merely as a terrorist organization but as a unique venture for a sitting U.S. president.

In a moment of candor, Obama confided in his close ally, Hillary Clinton, about his aspirations for ISIS. The two met in a casual setting, sharing Popsicles as they basked in the warmth of their friendship. It was during this seemingly innocent gathering that Obama revealed a shocking secret: he claimed to be a 97-year-old Kenyan man with a grandiose plot to undermine America from within. His dog, Bo, he suggested, would serve as a communication tool for terrorist organizations, adding an absurd twist to his already bizarre narrative.

Hillary, taken aback by Obama’s revelations, exhibited a mix of disbelief and confusion. However, the absurdity of the situation did not deter her curiosity. Instead, she found herself intrigued by the ideas Obama was presenting. The two spent hours discussing the concept of ISIS in the serene setting of the Rose Garden, their conversation flowing freely as they bonded over their shared ambitions.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden hue over the garden, Hillary proposed a strategic delay in their plans. She suggested that they wait until she became president to execute their scheme to “secretly destroy America.” This proposition left Obama feeling understood and invigorated by the prospect of collaboration with someone who shared his vision, no matter how outlandish it might seem.

The conversations between Obama and Clinton during those pivotal moments in the Rose Garden epitomized a friendship that transcended the ordinary. They delved into the intricacies of their plans, navigating the fine line between reality and imagination. The atmosphere was charged with excitement, the potential for a partnership that could reshape their legacies hanging in the air.

While the idea of ISIS as envisioned by Obama and Clinton remains firmly rooted in the realm of fiction, it serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of human thought and ambition. The surreal journey from a sleepless night in the White House to the vibrant fields of Coachella illustrates how creativity can flourish in the most unexpected circumstances.

In retrospect, the whimsical origins of ISIS as conceived by Obama highlight the importance of dialogue and collaboration in shaping ideas, no matter how unconventional they may appear. The bond formed between him and Hillary during those discussions reflects the power of friendship and shared aspirations, even in the face of absurdity.

As we reflect on this bizarre narrative, it becomes clear that the fabric of history is often woven with threads of imagination, ambition, and the occasional touch of whimsy. The story of Obama’s sleepless night, his Post-It note, and his conversation with Hillary Clinton serves as a testament to the unpredictable paths that can lead to profound ideas, reminding us all that creativity knows no bounds.",-4.0,19.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,826.0,0.6333333333333333,0.023002421307506054
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the landscape of American politics, campaign promises often serve as the bedrock of a candidate's platform. However, history has shown that such promises can sometimes lead to unforeseen consequences. Frank Wilkenmeyer, a political commentator, has drawn parallels between current promises and past missteps, notably referencing George H.W. Bush's infamous ""no new taxes"" pledge, which ultimately became a significant point of contention during his presidency. As the political climate continues to evolve, the recent statements made by Donald Trump regarding terrorism have raised eyebrows and sparked debate about the implications of his rhetoric.

Following a series of attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, Trump declared his intention to ""destroy"" terrorism in America. This bold assertion, while appealing to a populace shaken by violence, is rife with complexities that warrant scrutiny. Trump's statement did not just stop at addressing terrorism; it also included personal attacks directed at President Obama and Secretary Clinton, framing them as ineffective in combating the threat. This combative approach, while energizing to some supporters, raises critical questions about the broader implications of such rhetoric on national unity and social cohesion.

One of the most concerning aspects of Trump's promise to ""destroy all terrorists"" is the potential for profiling, particularly of Muslim communities. The fear that his administration could adopt policies that disproportionately target individuals based on their religion is palpable among civil rights advocates. The specter of discrimination looms large, as communities worry about being unfairly scrutinized or labeled as suspects based solely on their faith. This concern is compounded by a historical context where similar tactics have led to widespread injustice and civil liberties violations.

Moreover, Trump's approach raises alarms about the potential erosion of due process and constitutional rights. The notion of ""destroying"" a group of people, regardless of their actions, can lead to a slippery slope where the rights of suspects are sidelined in favor of a more aggressive and less discerning approach to national security. Critics argue that this could result in a legal framework where individuals are presumed guilty rather than innocent, a fundamental shift that undermines the very principles upon which the American justice system is built.

The implications of Trump's promises extend beyond rhetoric; they could manifest in tangible changes to daily life, particularly in neighborhoods with significant Muslim populations. The prospect of heavily patrolled areas, where citizens are constantly monitored under the guise of security, paints a troubling picture of a society living in fear. Such measures could breed resentment and division, further alienating communities that are already grappling with the impacts of discrimination and bias.

Wilkenmeyer cautions against what he perceives as a fascistic tendency in Trump's language. The absence of a focus on prevention, education, and community engagement in his proposed solutions is alarming. Instead of fostering understanding and cooperation, Trump's rhetoric seems to cultivate an environment of hostility and fear. This departure from constructive dialogue raises concerns about the long-term ramifications for American society, particularly in terms of social cohesion and mutual respect.

As the discourse surrounding terrorism and national security continues to evolve, it is crucial to critically assess the feasibility and morality of Trump's promises. The assertion that one can ""destroy"" terrorism oversimplifies a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding and a multifaceted approach. History has shown us that sweeping promises often fall short of their intended goals, leading to disillusionment and frustration among the populace. 

In conclusion, Trump's promise to eradicate terrorism is not only unrealistic but also echoes the failures of past political pledges. The fear-mongering tactics employed in his campaign may resonate with some, but they ultimately threaten to deepen divisions within the country. As the nation grapples with the challenges of security and civil rights, it is imperative to seek solutions grounded in understanding, prevention, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background. The path forward must prioritize unity over division, and hope over fear, lest we repeat the mistakes of the past.",-28.0,-36.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,759.0,-1.1612903225806452,-0.04743083003952569

Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component.

At the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno issued a stark warning regarding the escalating threats posed by global terrorism and increased hostilities from the Soviet Union and North Korea. He expressed concern that the current geopolitical climate is approaching a dangerous tipping point that could have dire implications for U.S. security.

Odierno noted that the Army is currently generating readiness levels sufficient only to meet immediate operational needs. He cautioned that any further reductions in military capacity would lead to critical consequences, potentially compromising the Army's ability to respond effectively to emerging threats.

The general highlighted a widening gap between the administration and military leadership, attributing this divide to the Obama Administration's consistent disregard for military advice. He argued that this neglect has not only undermined military effectiveness but has also contributed to the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa.

Critically, Odierno did not hold back in his assessment of the administration's approach, labeling it as marked by incompetence and arrogance. He suggested that such attitudes have adversely impacted military careers and the overall readiness of the armed forces.

In his address, Odierno underscored that the United States is currently facing a strategic inflection point. He pointed out that determined adversaries are actively threatening both U.S. and allied security, necessitating a reevaluation of military priorities and resources.

The Army has already seen significant reductions, with an active force decrease of 80,000 soldiers and the elimination of 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades. Furthermore, investment in military modernization has plummeted by 25%, which has adversely affected critical development programs for infantry fighting vehicles and scout helicopters.

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.

The senator expressed particular concern over the potential for countries such as Russia, China, and Iran to censor online content, which could extend to U.S. citizens and their access to information. With the transfer set to take effect on September 30, 2016, Cruz is urging Congress to take immediate action to prevent this proposal from being implemented.

He emphasized the urgency of the situation, noting that many Americans remain unaware of the implications of this transfer. Cruz's remarks highlight a growing apprehension about foreign control over critical aspects of the Internet, raising questions about the future of digital freedom and the integrity of online discourse. As the deadline approaches, the debate over the control of Internet domains intensifies, with calls for greater awareness and legislative intervention.",3.0,9.0,218.0,0.2727272727272727,0.013761467889908258,213.0,1.2857142857142858,0.04225352112676056
Fake_26-Webpage,Clemson BANS Memes Featuring Dead Gorilla Harambe…Promotes “Rape Culture” and “Racism” – Eagle Rising,"Clemson University freshmen may no longer publicly display Harambe-related memes because they “add to rape culture” and can be “a form of racism.”

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the nation approaches a pivotal election, concerns surrounding election integrity have taken center stage. Every state has laws governing election procedures, designed to ensure a fair and democratic process. However, a prominent voice has emerged, raising alarms about the potential for voter fraud and the implications of certain electoral practices.

The author, a self-identified Christian and Constitutional Conservative, has voiced strong opinions regarding the Democratic Party, labeling it a ""powerful hate group"" intent on ""stealing elections."" This characterization reflects a broader narrative that suggests the party's motives extend beyond traditional political competition, with the author claiming that the Democratic Party seeks to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States.

Among the most serious allegations directed at the Democratic Party are those of voter fraud and ballot stuffing, particularly in relation to the November 2016 election. The author argues that while proper election procedures should encourage citizen participation, the Democratic Party is purportedly advocating for practices that enable fraudulent voting. This assertion raises questions about the integrity of the electoral process and the motivations behind certain legislative proposals.

A key point of contention is the requirement for photo identification for voters. The author contends that implementing such laws is essential to ensure that only eligible and registered individuals participate in elections. This argument is bolstered by claims that the Democratic Party opposes voter ID laws not out of concern for accessibility, but rather to facilitate the inclusion of ineligible voters in the electoral process. The author posits that these measures are crucial for maintaining the sanctity of elections and preventing potential abuses.

Criticism extends beyond the Democratic Party itself, encompassing the Obama administration, Congress, and the federal court system. The author argues that these entities have collectively suppressed fair election laws, contributing to an environment where voter fraud could thrive. This perspective highlights a perceived systemic failure to uphold the principles of democracy and ensure that elections are conducted fairly.

In light of these concerns, the author has called upon citizens to take proactive measures in the upcoming election. There is a strong emphasis on the importance of volunteering to monitor polling places, a move aimed at preventing any instances of voter fraud. This grassroots approach underscores a belief that ordinary citizens have a role to play in safeguarding the electoral process and ensuring that every vote cast is legitimate.

Amidst this discourse, Donald Trump is portrayed positively, with the author emphasizing his commitment to saving the country from what they perceive as impending tyranny. This endorsement of Trump aligns with the broader narrative that positions him as a bulwark against the alleged threats posed by the Democratic Party. The author’s perspective suggests that the stakes are particularly high in the upcoming election, framing November 8, 2016, as a critical juncture for the preservation of the republic.

The urgency of the author's message resonates throughout their writing, as they urge citizens to remain vigilant and active in monitoring elections to prevent fraud. This call to action is rooted in a deep-seated belief that the integrity of the electoral process is paramount to the functioning of democracy.

It is important to note that the views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of EagleRising.com. As the election approaches, the discourse surrounding voter integrity and election procedures will likely continue to evolve, capturing the attention of citizens across the nation. The implications of these discussions are significant, as they touch upon the very foundations of democratic participation and the principles that govern the electoral system.

In conclusion, as the nation gears up for the upcoming election, the conversation surrounding voter fraud, election integrity, and the role of citizens in safeguarding democracy remains as relevant as ever. The author’s passionate appeal for vigilance and action serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges that accompany the electoral process in contemporary America.",-52.0,-1.0,678.0,-3.466666666666667,-0.07669616519174041,735.0,-0.03571428571428571,-0.0013605442176870747
Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the annals of political advertising, few pieces have resonated as profoundly as the 1964 ""Daisy"" ad, which was instrumental in President Lyndon B. Johnson’s campaign against Barry Goldwater. This iconic advertisement, which featured a young girl plucking petals from a daisy before transitioning to a stark nuclear explosion, effectively painted Goldwater as a warmonger—an image that Johnson’s campaign sought to cement in the minds of voters. Despite Johnson's own controversial Vietnam policies, the ad succeeded in its purpose, showcasing the power of strategic messaging in shaping public perception.

As we navigate the current political landscape, one cannot help but ponder the potential for a modern rendition of the ""Daisy"" ad, particularly in relation to Hillary Clinton. The notion of leveraging a similar approach to underscore Clinton's failures could serve as a formidable weapon in her opponents' arsenals, potentially undermining her campaign significantly. The political climate today is rife with opportunities for such a strategy, as the electorate is increasingly attuned to the shortcomings of candidates, especially those with a long history in politics.

Rumors have circulated regarding a ""Daisy"" remake aimed at Donald Trump, which may indicate a sense of desperation among Clinton's campaign staff. The idea of resurrecting a historical ad to target a contemporary candidate speaks volumes about the current state of political strategy. It suggests that, rather than crafting new narratives based on current events, some campaigns may feel compelled to rely on the weight of historical precedent to sway voters. This reliance on past tactics raises questions about the effectiveness of such strategies in an era where voters are more discerning and less susceptible to overt manipulation.

Moreover, the political landscape is further complicated by voters' increasing disregard for biased media coverage. An illustrative example of this phenomenon can be seen in the recent political shift of Ted Cruz, who has faced ridicule from media outlets for his changing positions. This situation underscores a growing trend where voters are beginning to look beyond the narratives crafted by the press, seeking their own interpretations of candidates and their policies. The media’s selective reporting often reinforces the perception of a ""liberal press,"" which, in turn, can alienate segments of the electorate who feel their perspectives are not being represented.

The significance of retaining critical details from news stories cannot be overstated. In a climate where key information is often buried beneath layers of sensationalism, voters must navigate a complex landscape to discern the truth. This challenge is exacerbated by the media's tendency to focus on surface-level narratives, which can obscure the underlying issues that truly matter to voters. As we approach the upcoming presidential debate, concerns regarding the style of moderation and the potential for bias loom large, reminiscent of past controversies that have marred public discourse.

Reflecting on the criticisms leveled against Hillary Clinton by both Barack Obama and Michelle Obama during their respective campaigns, it becomes clear that these sentiments remain relevant in the context of her current candidacy. The Obamas' critiques highlighted vulnerabilities that continue to resonate with voters today, suggesting that the past holds valuable lessons for the present. As Clinton seeks to position herself as a viable candidate, the echoes of previous criticisms serve as a reminder of the challenges she faces in winning over an electorate that is increasingly skeptical of established politicians.

In light of these reflections, the call for a new ""Daisy"" commercial that documents Clinton's shortcomings becomes increasingly compelling. Such an advertisement could harness the emotional weight of the original while addressing contemporary issues that resonate with today’s voters. By focusing on the realities of her political record and the implications of her past decisions, a modern ""Daisy"" ad could prove to be more impactful than its predecessor. It would serve not only as a critique of Clinton's candidacy but also as a reminder of the importance of accountability in political leadership.

Ultimately, the legacy of the ""Daisy"" ad serves as both a historical touchstone and a cautionary tale for contemporary political campaigns. The power of visual storytelling in shaping public opinion cannot be underestimated, and as we witness the evolution of political advertising, it is essential to consider how these narratives are crafted and the implications they hold for our democratic process. As candidates gear up for the next presidential election, the lessons learned from past campaigns will undoubtedly inform the strategies employed in the quest for the highest office in the land.

In conclusion, the potential for a modern ""Daisy"" ad aimed at highlighting the shortcomings of candidates like Hillary Clinton raises important questions about the effectiveness of political messaging in today’s complex media environment. As voters become more discerning and media narratives continue to evolve, the need for authentic and transparent communication has never been more critical. The call for a new advertisement that captures the essence of the original while addressing current realities may very well be the key to unlocking the electorate's attention and fostering a more informed and engaged voter base.",-18.0,6.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,955.0,0.1935483870967742,0.0062827225130890054

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

If you question the veracity of a black president’s birth certificate you are racist. That is the outright claim of Lynn Sweet Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times made on Fox News.

First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification.

However, critics argue that labeling individuals as racist for raising such questions is flawed reasoning, often described as a non-sequitur.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The article discusses a violent homophobic attack on Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual, in May 2016.

In May 2016, a violent homophobic attack on 26-year-old Aaron Woods has left the community in shock and mourning. Woods, who identifies as homosexual, was approached by a man who unleashed a barrage of homophobic slurs before physically assaulting him. The brutal attack resulted in a broken jaw, highlighting the ongoing violence faced by members of the LGBTQ+ community.

Witnesses to the incident reported that the assailant shouted phrases like “Muslim stuff” during the assault, further intensifying the already charged atmosphere surrounding the attack. Woods’ friend described him as a gentle person who has been severely impacted by the incident, emphasizing the emotional and physical toll such violence can take on individuals and their loved ones.

This attack is not an isolated incident; earlier in May, a similar assault occurred involving a gay couple who were attacked by two men. These events have raised serious concerns about the safety of LGBTQ+ individuals in the area and the broader implications of such hate-fueled violence.

In response to the attacks, Sussex police confirmed that prompt arrests were made in both cases, and they reported that the victims were on the path to recovery. While these arrests provide a measure of justice, the incidents have sparked a broader conversation about the acceptance of the gay community in the face of radical ideologies that condemn homosexuality.

The stark contrast between the acceptance of the gay community and the views held by radical Islam has come to the forefront of discussions following the attacks. While some American Muslims may express more tolerant views towards LGBTQ+ individuals, it is evident that radical Islam and the gay community cannot coexist peacefully. 

As society grapples with these issues, the need for dialogue and understanding becomes increasingly important. The violent attack on Aaron Woods serves as a painful reminder of the challenges that still lie ahead in the fight for acceptance and equality. The community is left to reflect on the urgent need for solidarity against hate and violence, advocating for a world where diversity is celebrated rather than condemned.",-26.0,-48.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,385.0,-3.4285714285714284,-0.12467532467532468
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

On a chilling Saturday night in St. Cloud, Minnesota, chaos erupted at a local mall when a man dressed in a security uniform launched a violent attack on unsuspecting shoppers. The assailant, later identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and Muslim, reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" as he began his rampage, leaving nine individuals injured in his wake. Eyewitness accounts reveal a scene of panic and confusion as shoppers sought safety amidst the chaos.

Adan's assault was not random; he specifically targeted individuals based on their religious identity, asking at least one person if they were Muslim before launching an attack. This troubling detail has raised significant concerns within the local community, particularly among the St. Cloud Somali-American population, who quickly recognized Adan as the perpetrator. Community leaders expressed shock and dismay, emphasizing that such actions do not reflect the values of their culture or faith.

In the aftermath of the attack, ISIS claimed responsibility, asserting that Adan was affiliated with their organization. This declaration has intensified fears regarding the recruitment of Somali-Americans by extremist groups like ISIS and al-Shabaab. The incident marks a troubling trend, following other violent acts linked to radical ideology, including a bomb attack at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey and a meat cleaver assault on police officers in New York.

Community officials from the St. Cloud Somali community have rallied around Adan's family, describing him as a good person and an accomplished student. They are grappling with the implications of his actions, attempting to distance their community from the violence that has drawn national attention. The support for Adan's family reflects the complexities of identity and the challenges faced by Somali refugees in Minnesota, who have increasingly found themselves in the crosshairs of scrutiny and suspicion.

The swift response from law enforcement was pivotal in preventing further tragedy. Officer Jason Falconer, an off-duty police officer, confronted Adan during the attack and ultimately shot him, ending the violence. Mayor of St. Cloud praised Falconer as a hero, highlighting the critical role of law enforcement in safeguarding the community during such crises.

However, the incident has reignited debates surrounding the safety and integration of Somali refugees in Minnesota. Reports indicate that this community has faced numerous challenges, including threats and criminal activities, which have contributed to a growing sense of vulnerability. As discussions unfold, concerns about the potential targeting of Somali-Americans by terrorist organizations loom large, prompting calls for greater awareness and preventative measures.

The backdrop of this attack is further complicated by the political landscape surrounding immigration and refugee policies. The narrative surrounding Somali refugees in Minnesota has often been fraught with fear and suspicion, particularly in light of the potential increase in Muslim refugees under a future Clinton administration. This context has fostered a strong political stance against Hillary Clinton, with some advocating for Donald Trump as a means to address these concerns.

As the community processes the aftermath of this tragic event, the focus remains on healing and resilience. Leaders within the Somali-American community are working tirelessly to ensure that the actions of one individual do not define their identity as a whole. They emphasize the importance of unity and understanding, urging both community members and the broader public to reject the narratives that seek to stigmatize their culture.

In the days following the attack, vigils and community gatherings have emerged as a testament to solidarity and support. Residents of St. Cloud are coming together to honor the victims and promote messages of peace and coexistence. The Somali community, in particular, is striving to reaffirm their commitment to the values of compassion and community service that have long characterized their presence in Minnesota.

As authorities continue their investigation into the motivations behind the attack, the broader implications for the Somali-American community remain a pressing concern. The need for dialogue and understanding is paramount, as is the recognition of the contributions that Somali immigrants have made to the fabric of Minnesota society.

In the face of adversity, the St. Cloud community stands resilient, determined to overcome the shadows cast by this tragic event. The commitment to fostering a safe and inclusive environment is stronger than ever, as residents work together to ensure that the narrative surrounding Somali-Americans is one of hope, resilience, and community strength.

The attack on Saturday night serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that communities face in the wake of violence and extremism. It underscores the importance of addressing the root causes of radicalization and the need for comprehensive support systems for immigrants and refugees. As the community reflects on the events of that night, the call for unity and understanding resonates louder than ever, paving the way for healing and a renewed commitment to coexistence.

In conclusion, the St. Cloud mall attack has not only left physical scars but has also ignited a broader conversation about identity, belonging, and the complexities of immigrant experiences in America. As the community navigates this difficult chapter, the hope is that resilience will prevail, and that the values of compassion and understanding will ultimately triumph over fear and division.",-72.0,-7.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,961.0,-0.1590909090909091,-0.007284079084287201
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In recent years, millennials have often been characterized as the ""everyone gets a trophy generation,"" a label reflecting a perceived decline in standards for effort and an increasing culture of victimhood. This narrative becomes particularly poignant when examining the case of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the bombings that rocked New Jersey and New York City in 2016. Rahami's claims of victimhood, particularly in relation to his Muslim faith, have sparked a broader discussion about the implications of victimhood culture in America.

Rahami, who was arrested following the bombings, previously asserted that he was a victim of ""Islamophobia."" In 2011, he and his father took legal action against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police department, alleging discrimination based on their Muslim identity. The lawsuit claimed that local law enforcement subjected the Rahami family to discriminatory practices and ""selective enforcement,"" including attempts to shut down their family-owned chicken restaurant, First American.

The Rahami family's grievances extended beyond law enforcement actions. They alleged that they faced racial abuse from local residents, with claims that they were told, ""Muslims don’t belong here."" This narrative of victimization was woven into their lawsuit, which highlighted Rahami's frustrations with city officials and local authorities. 

In response to the allegations, Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage firmly denied the claims of discrimination. He attributed the complaints against the Rahami family to issues related to noise and street congregation rather than any biases tied to ethnicity or religion. This denial raises questions about the nature of victimhood and the complexities involved in navigating cultural and racial tensions within communities.

The Rahami family's fried chicken restaurant became a focal point in the aftermath of the bombings, as five bombs were discovered at a nearby train station shortly after the attacks. This connection between the alleged discrimination and the subsequent criminal actions of Rahami adds a layer of complexity to the discussion surrounding victimhood culture. It prompts reflection on how individuals may navigate their identities in a society that often emphasizes victimization.

Critics of victimhood culture argue that it can lead to a cycle of blame and resentment, where individuals may seek to position themselves as victims rather than taking accountability for their actions. In the case of Rahami, the juxtaposition of his claims of discrimination against the backdrop of his alleged terrorist activities raises important questions about the narrative of victimhood in America, particularly in the context of terrorism.

As society grapples with the implications of these narratives, the case of Ahmad Khan Rahami serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding identity, victimhood, and accountability. It challenges us to consider how cultural perceptions shape our understanding of justice and the responsibilities that come with it.",-38.0,-35.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,516.0,-1.8421052631578947,-0.06782945736434108
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically threatened to move businesses if workers don't vote as desired, often leading to negative outcomes for employees.

In a climate of increasing political polarization, employers have historically leveraged the power of the ballot box to influence their employees' voting decisions, often issuing threats that can lead to negative repercussions for workers. This trend has gained renewed scrutiny with the recent statements from Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, who has made explicit threats regarding economic actions contingent upon the outcome of the upcoming election.

Puzder, a vocal critic of Democratic policies, has declared that he plans to fully automate his restaurants if a Democrat wins the election. He cites rising labor costs as the primary motivation for this shift towards automation. This announcement has raised eyebrows, particularly among his 20,000 employees and the broader fast-food workforce, as it appears to be an attempt to sway their votes against their own economic interests.

The automation strategy Puzder references is reminiscent of the automated restaurant concept Eatsa, where customers place their orders through kiosks, eliminating the need for human interaction. This model reflects a growing trend within the fast-food industry, where employers are increasingly turning to technology to cut costs and maximize profits. However, the implications for workers are significant, as such moves can lead to job losses and diminished opportunities in an already challenging labor market.

Puzder has been outspoken in his criticism of minimum wage increases, arguing that these policies ultimately result in job losses rather than providing tangible benefits for workers. His stance has sparked debate among labor advocates who argue that higher wages can lead to improved living standards and increased consumer spending, which can benefit businesses in the long run. Nevertheless, Puzder's position indicates a clear preference for prioritizing profits over workforce welfare.

In his efforts to influence his employees' voting behavior, Puzder appears to be leveraging his platform to promote a political agenda that aligns with his business interests. He maintains a blog focused on politics and capitalism, where he shares his views on various issues. However, it is important to note that these views may not reflect the sentiments of his employees, many of whom may feel caught in the crossfire of corporate politics and their own economic realities.

Despite Puzder's significant earnings—reportedly nearly $4.5 million in 2012—and the rising profits of his companies, there is a stark contrast between his financial success and the economic conditions faced by his employees. While he has benefited from the growth of the fast-food industry, many of his workers struggle to make ends meet, raising questions about the distribution of wealth within the sector.

The prospect of automation looms large over the fast-food industry, and Puzder's statements suggest that he is likely to pursue this path regardless of the election outcome. This commitment to automation underscores a broader trend in which businesses prioritize technological advancements and cost-cutting measures over the stability and welfare of their workforce.

As the election approaches, the implications of Puzder's threats resonate beyond the walls of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. The fast-food industry, which employs millions of workers across the country, faces critical decisions about the future of work, labor rights, and the balance between profit and people. The conversations surrounding these issues are becoming increasingly urgent, as workers seek to navigate a landscape that is rapidly changing due to technological advancements and shifting political dynamics.

In conclusion, the actions and statements of leaders like Andy Puzder serve as a reminder of the ongoing tensions between labor and management. As employers continue to wield their influence in the political arena, it is essential for workers to remain informed and engaged in the electoral process, advocating for their rights and interests in the face of corporate pressure. The outcomes of these elections will undoubtedly shape the future of work in America, and the voices of employees must be heard in the conversation.",21.0,22.0,642.0,0.8076923076923077,0.03271028037383177,723.0,0.9166666666666666,0.030428769017980636
Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category

In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a significant development that has reignited scrutiny over Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State, the FBI is investigating new evidence that could have serious implications for Clinton and her close aide, Huma Abedin. The evidence emerged during an unrelated investigation into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Abedin, and pertains to a shared laptop that may contain ""tens of thousands of emails"" from Abedin, including forwarded emails from Clinton's account that were not previously submitted to the FBI.

The discovery of these emails raises critical questions about the integrity of the original investigation into Clinton's email practices. If the emails in question are determined to be work-related or classified, it could suggest that both Clinton and Abedin misled the FBI during their initial inquiries. Such actions could be considered a prosecutable offense, further complicating an already contentious political landscape.

The urgency surrounding this investigation was underscored by the timing of the FBI's letter regarding the findings, which was released just 11 days before the presidential election. This move has been interpreted as an indication of the seriousness of the evidence uncovered and has sparked a flurry of reactions from both supporters and opponents of Clinton.

The backdrop to this renewed investigation dates back to July 5, 2016, when FBI Director James Comey publicly stated that there was evidence against Clinton regarding her email practices. However, he did not recommend charges, a decision that left many within the FBI and intelligence agencies dismayed. Reports emerged that a high-ranking FBI official had expressed a strong desire within the bureau to revoke Clinton's security clearance and pursue prosecution, reflecting the internal tensions and differing opinions on how to handle the case.

Adding to the complexity of the situation, a summary released by the FBI on October 17, 2016, revealed that a State Department official allegedly pressured the FBI to declassify information in exchange for additional agents at diplomatic posts. This revelation points to potential collusion between government officials and the FBI, raising ethical questions about the handling of sensitive information and the motivations behind certain actions.

The summary also highlighted discussions among a group of State Department officials regarding Freedom of Information requests related to Clinton's emails, a group that has been colloquially dubbed ""The Shadow Government."" This characterization has fueled speculation about the extent to which Clinton and her team may have attempted to shield their actions from public scrutiny.

Concerns regarding security protocol breaches have been a recurring theme in the narrative surrounding Clinton's email use. Notably, there was an incident where Clinton ignored security advice for a photo opportunity, which has been cited as an example of her disregard for established protocols. Such breaches have raised alarms about the potential risks posed to national security and the implications of having sensitive information on an unsecured private server.

The investigation has also drawn attention to the financial ties between political supporters and FBI officials. Reports surfaced that a Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to the wife of an FBI official involved in investigating Clinton's email practices. This revelation has raised eyebrows and led to accusations of impropriety, further complicating the narrative surrounding the investigation.

Central to the investigation is Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who was identified as the individual responsible for deleting over 33,000 emails from Clinton's server. Combetta was granted immunity in exchange for his cooperation with the investigation, a decision that has been met with criticism and skepticism. The circumstances surrounding the deletions have led to questions about the contents of those emails, with evidence suggesting that they may contain communications between Clinton and President Obama. This contradicts prior claims made by both Clinton and Obama regarding their knowledge of the private server.

Moreover, leaked emails have indicated that the White House may have engaged in efforts to cover up details related to Clinton's email use, with the goal of protecting her and preventing the disclosure of potentially damaging information. Such allegations have intensified the scrutiny of the administration's actions and have raised concerns about transparency and accountability within the highest levels of government.

As the investigation unfolds, a timeline of events provides context for the escalating situation. The New York Times first broke the story about Clinton's email use, setting off a chain reaction of inquiries, political fallout, and media coverage. Key moments in the timeline include the initial revelations, subsequent statements from FBI officials, and the ongoing discussions within various government agencies regarding the implications of Clinton's actions.

The renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices has not only reignited debates about her suitability for public office but has also raised fundamental questions about the integrity of governmental institutions and the accountability of public officials. As the FBI continues its inquiry, the political ramifications of these findings are likely to resonate far beyond the immediate investigation, shaping the discourse surrounding accountability, transparency, and the rule of law in the United States. 

In conclusion, the developments surrounding the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server underscore the complexities and challenges inherent in navigating political and legal landscapes. As new evidence emerges and the implications of past actions come to light, the stakes have never been higher for those involved. The investigation serves as a reminder of the critical importance of ethical conduct in public office and the need for transparency in government operations. As the nation approaches a pivotal election, the outcomes of this investigation will undoubtedly influence public perception and voter sentiment, making it a focal point in the ongoing dialogue about leadership, trust, and accountability in American politics.",-6.0,-7.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,1052.0,-0.2,-0.006653992395437262
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

In a recent address at her party's annual conference, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed regret over her administration's open borders policy that welcomed Syrian refugees during the height of the migrant crisis. Merkel, a staunch advocate for accepting migrants, acknowledged that the influx had resulted in significant challenges, including rising crime rates in German cities.

The sharp increase in reported crimes, particularly thousands of sexual assaults and violent incidents, has sparked public outcry and concern. This backlash has had political ramifications, leading to a notable electoral defeat for Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party in recent elections. As the public's perception of safety and security became intertwined with the refugee situation, Merkel's once-popular stance faced increasing scrutiny.

During her speech, Merkel reflected on the consequences of her decisions, admitting that the migrant crisis could have been avoided. She controversially described the notion of multiculturalism as a “living lie,” signaling a shift in her perspective on the integration of refugees into German society. 

While Merkel reiterated her previous slogan, ""we can do this,"" she acknowledged the necessity for Germany to regain control over the migrant influx. The Chancellor emphasized that unchecked migration could overwhelm both the state and society, necessitating a reevaluation of current policies.

In response to the growing concerns, Merkel announced plans to significantly reduce the number of refugees entering Germany. However, she resisted calls to establish a hard limit on arrivals, indicating her desire to maintain a degree of openness while addressing the pressing issues at hand.

Merkel underscored the need for a coordinated approach to migration, advocating for collaboration at the German, European, and global levels. She stressed that a unified strategy is essential for effectively regulating and limiting migration, ensuring that both humanitarian obligations and public safety are balanced.

As Germany grapples with the complexities of migration and integration, Merkel's reflections mark a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate over the nation's refugee policy. The Chancellor's recognition of the challenges ahead suggests a shift in approach as Germany navigates the delicate balance between compassion and security.",-2.0,-7.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,405.0,-0.4666666666666667,-0.01728395061728395

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two.",http://freedomdaily.com/disgusting-because-of-hillary-obama-ny-terrorist-will-get-better-treatment-than-us-vets/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3895D4C900000578-3798726-Ahmad_Khan_Rahami_28_was_taken_into_custody_on_Monday_after_a_sh-a-65_1474398076306.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a troubling revelation, a terrorist who planted explosives in New Jersey and New York City is poised to receive better medical care than many U.S. veterans. This situation underscores persistent challenges within the Veteran’s Administration (VA), which has been marred by scandals over long waiting lists and inefficiencies since 2014. 

During a recent campaign speech, former President Donald Trump voiced his outrage over this disparity in treatment. He highlighted that while the terrorist will benefit from excellent hospitalization and legal representation, countless veterans are left waiting for the care they desperately need. Trump’s remarks resonate with a growing frustration among veterans and their advocates, who have long criticized the VA for its inability to provide timely and adequate services.

The statistics surrounding veteran care are alarming. Over 300,000 veterans have died while waiting for VA services, a staggering figure that emphasizes the dire state of the system. Moreover, the issue of veteran suicides has become increasingly pressing, with many soldiers taking their own lives while still in the queue for care. This tragic reality serves as a grim reminder of the urgent need for improved support for returning soldiers who have sacrificed so much for their country.

The ethical implications of providing care to a terrorist also pose a significant moral dilemma for medical professionals. Many grapple with the conflict of treating someone who has attempted to inflict harm on innocent Americans. This situation raises questions about the values of the healthcare system and the principles that guide medical practitioners when faced with such cases.

As the nation reflects on these issues, the disparity in treatment between a terrorist and U.S. veterans highlights a critical need for reform within the VA. Advocates are calling for immediate changes to ensure that veterans receive the care they deserve, arguing that those who have served the country should not have to compete for resources with individuals who have sought to harm it.

The ongoing struggles within the VA are a reminder of the sacrifices made by veterans and the importance of addressing their needs with urgency and compassion. As the debate continues, it is essential for lawmakers and the public to prioritize the well-being of those who have served, ensuring they receive timely and adequate medical care without unnecessary delays. The situation is a call to action for a system that honors the commitment of veterans while holding accountable those who undermine their care.",13.0,-7.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,452.0,-0.4117647058823529,-0.015486725663716814
Fake_37-Webpage,DESPICABLE! Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS ⋆ Freedom Daily,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",http://freedomdaily.com/despicable-hillary-wants-put-hero-cop-stopped-mall-terror-attack-business/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-vs-cop.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a dramatic incident that unfolded in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, heroically intervened when an ISIS terrorist launched an attack on eight unsuspecting individuals. Falconer’s quick and decisive action not only saved lives but also highlighted the importance of responsible firearm training for law-abiding citizens.

Falconer operates Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., a business dedicated to educating individuals on the use of concealed firearms for self-defense. With a full-service training facility that includes a firing range and gun sales, Tactical Advantage has become a vital resource for those seeking to protect themselves and their families. However, Falconer now faces a significant threat from the political aspirations of Hillary Clinton.

If elected president, Clinton has made it clear that she intends to eliminate Falconer’s business. Her proposed policies could drive Tactical Advantage into bankruptcy, jeopardizing the livelihoods of those who rely on Falconer’s training. This potential fallout raises critical questions about the future of firearms training in the United States and the rights of citizens to defend themselves.

Central to this political battle is the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which currently provides legal protections to businesses like Falconer’s. Clinton has expressed her desire to repeal this act, a move that would expose firearms training businesses to a barrage of lawsuits. Critics of Clinton have pointed out that her claims regarding the PLCAA are misleading; she has been accused of falsely asserting that the act grants gunmakers and dealers “immunity” from all legal actions.

The implications of Clinton’s policies extend beyond just Falconer’s business. They represent a broader threat to Second Amendment rights, which are increasingly under scrutiny in today’s political climate. Falconer, who has dedicated his life to protecting citizens—first as a police officer and now through his firearms training company—embodies the values of self-defense and personal responsibility that many Americans hold dear.

As the nation gears up for the upcoming election, the stakes have never been higher. Voters are encouraged to consider the impact of their choices on individuals like Jason Falconer, who work tirelessly to ensure that citizens can exercise their right to self-defense. The potential for Clinton’s policies to dismantle businesses like Tactical Advantage raises alarms about the future of firearm training and the rights of citizens to protect themselves.

In a time when safety and security are paramount concerns for many, the importance of accessible firearms training cannot be overstated. Falconer’s work provides essential skills and knowledge to individuals who wish to defend themselves and their loved ones. The possibility of losing such resources due to political maneuvers underscores the urgency for voters to take action.

As the election approaches, it is crucial for citizens to voice their opposition to candidates whose policies threaten the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Second Amendment. Supporting individuals like Jason Falconer, who have dedicated their lives to the protection and education of others, is essential in preserving these rights.

In conclusion, the political landscape surrounding firearms training is fraught with tension as figures like Hillary Clinton seek to impose restrictive policies that could have far-reaching consequences. The story of Jason Falconer serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of standing up for Second Amendment rights and the need for voters to make informed decisions that will safeguard their freedoms.",-11.0,32.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,645.0,1.2307692307692308,0.04961240310077519

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air. It’s incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack — *GASP excuse me, President of the United States.

As the presidential election approaches, the health of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has emerged as a critical topic in political discussions and voter sentiment. Recent polling data reveals a growing concern among registered voters regarding Clinton's health, which has become a focal point for both supporters and opponents alike.

A recent survey indicates that over 40% of registered voters now perceive Clinton's health as ""below average"" or ""very poor."" This figure marks a notable increase from just 26% in late August, highlighting a shift in public perception. Meanwhile, the percentage of voters who consider her health to be ""average"" has remained stable at 28%, suggesting that while some voters may still view her health as acceptable, a significant portion is increasingly worried.

In contrast, former President Donald Trump appears to be benefiting from a more favorable health perception among voters. The same poll shows that the number of individuals who rate Trump's health as ""above average"" or ""excellent"" has risen from 33% to 36%. In comparison, only 22% of voters feel similarly about Clinton's health, indicating a growing gap in public perception between the two candidates.

The awareness of Clinton's potential medical issues is striking, with approximately 80% of respondents acknowledging the concerns surrounding her health. This widespread awareness has been fueled by various factors, including her public appearances and anecdotal reports from those close to her. Observers have noted that Clinton's appearance may contribute to the perception that she looks older than her age, raising further questions about her well-being.

Reports have surfaced regarding Clinton's use of medications such as Coumadin and Provigil, which has added to the public's concern. These medications are often associated with serious health conditions, leading many to speculate about the implications for her ability to serve as president. Additionally, anecdotes from her assistant suggest that Clinton experiences bouts of confusion and fatigue, necessitating regular naps to recharge.

Several incidents during her campaign have raised alarms among voters and political analysts alike. Videos and images depicting Clinton appearing to pass out or needing assistance have circulated widely, prompting discussions about her fitness for office. Such moments have not only sparked concern but have also led to accusations that efforts are being made to suppress information regarding her health. Claims have emerged that videos documenting these health incidents are being removed from the internet, raising suspicions about transparency in her campaign.

The atmosphere at Clinton's campaign events has also been scrutinized. Observers have noted low attendance numbers, which some speculate may be a strategic decision to shield voters from witnessing any potential health issues firsthand. This approach has drawn criticism, as it may suggest an attempt to control the narrative surrounding her health rather than addressing the concerns directly.

Moreover, Clinton's frequent coughing during speeches has captured significant public attention. This persistent symptom has not only raised eyebrows but has also become a talking point in discussions about her overall health. Voters are increasingly attuned to these details, and the impact of such observations can be profound in the context of a presidential election.

As the campaign progresses, the implications of Clinton's health perceptions could have far-reaching consequences for her candidacy. Voters' concerns about her ability to perform the duties of the presidency may influence their decisions at the ballot box. The stark contrast between her health perception and that of her opponent could further complicate her campaign strategy as she seeks to reassure voters of her fitness for office.

In summary, Hillary Clinton's health has become a pivotal issue in the current presidential election cycle. The significant rise in the percentage of voters who view her health unfavorably, coupled with the increasing awareness of her potential medical issues, paints a challenging picture for her campaign. As the election date approaches, the focus on her health is unlikely to wane, and Clinton will need to address these concerns head-on to maintain support among voters. The stakes are high, and how she navigates this sensitive topic could ultimately shape the outcome of the election.",-11.0,20.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,773.0,0.6451612903225806,0.0258732212160414

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

Dolly Kyle has stirred the political waters with the release of her new book, *Hillary: The Other Woman*, which presents a series of controversial claims about former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The book offers a personal narrative from Kyle, who dated Bill Clinton during high school and maintained a sexual relationship with him after graduation.

In her memoir, Kyle paints a vivid picture of Hillary Clinton's alleged aggressive demeanor towards those she considers beneath her. She claims that during her tenure as First Lady of Arkansas, Hillary made derogatory comments and used racial slurs, reflecting a troubling attitude towards individuals she encountered. One particularly shocking incident recounted in the book involves Hillary expressing frustration during an Easter egg hunt, reportedly saying, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?” This statement, according to Kyle, highlights a broader disdain Hillary held for certain groups of people.

Kyle further describes Hillary's perception of Arkansas residents, suggesting that she viewed them as ""ignorant hillbillies,"" despite her own upbringing in a middle-class suburb of Illinois. This portrayal contrasts starkly with the image Hillary has cultivated over the years.

The book also touches on the Clintons' dissatisfaction with their time in Arkansas, noting that Bill Clinton chose not to seek reelection in 1990 as he set his sights on higher political ambitions. As he transitioned into national politics, Hillary reportedly altered her public persona, claiming to be a lifelong Yankees fan to connect with New Yorkers.

*Hillary: The Other Woman* is poised to reignite discussions about the Clintons, presenting a perspective that challenges the couple's carefully crafted narratives and raises questions about their past.",-10.0,-12.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,343.0,-1.2,-0.03498542274052478

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a landmark decision, a Massachusetts judge has ruled in favor of a special law that applies exclusively to black males, a ruling which cannot be appealed. The implications of this decision are already raising significant concerns regarding public safety and the operational effectiveness of police officers across the state.

The judge's ruling stems from the acknowledgment of a pervasive fear among some black Americans regarding interactions with law enforcement. This fear has shaped the legal landscape, leading to a controversial provision that allows individuals who feel ""disproportionately targeted"" by police to flee without facing legal consequences. This significant shift in the law marks a departure from previous legal standards, where running from police could establish ""reasonable suspicion"" and trigger detention and investigation.

Critics of the ruling argue that it may severely hinder police officers' ability to protect and serve their communities effectively. By allowing individuals to evade law enforcement without repercussions, the ruling could undermine the authority of police officers and complicate their efforts to maintain public safety. The legal community and law enforcement officials are expressing skepticism about the potential outcomes of this decision, particularly regarding its impact on crime rates and community relations.

The ruling has sparked a heated debate about the balance between addressing systemic inequalities and ensuring public safety. Advocates for the law argue that it is a necessary step toward acknowledging and rectifying the historical injustices faced by black Americans. However, opponents suggest that the law may inadvertently benefit those with criminal intent, creating an environment where individuals can escape accountability for unlawful behavior.

As the implications of this ruling unfold, law enforcement agencies are grappling with how to adapt to the new legal framework. Officers are now faced with the challenge of navigating a landscape where the pursuit of suspects may be complicated by the legal protections afforded to certain individuals. The potential for increased tensions between police and communities is a concern that many are watching closely.

The ruling is a reflection of the ongoing national conversation about race, policing, and justice. As communities across the country continue to seek solutions to the complex issues of systemic racism and police accountability, Massachusetts finds itself at the forefront of a contentious legal and social debate.

In the coming weeks, stakeholders from various sectors, including law enforcement, community organizations, and legal experts, are expected to engage in discussions aimed at addressing the challenges posed by this ruling. The outcome of these conversations could shape the future of policing in Massachusetts and potentially influence similar legal frameworks in other states.

As this situation develops, the balance between ensuring justice for marginalized communities and maintaining public safety remains a critical issue that demands careful consideration and dialogue.",-13.0,5.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,510.0,0.2631578947368421,0.00980392156862745
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid admission, German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged that she would alter her open migrant policy if given the chance to revisit the past. This revelation comes on the heels of a disappointing electoral performance by her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in recent elections held in Berlin, which have highlighted a growing wave of anti-migrant sentiment in Germany.

Merkel's comments signal a potential shift in her approach to refugee policy, as she expressed a willingness to explore new directions in light of the changing political landscape. The CDU's defeat is seen as a direct reflection of public sentiment, which has increasingly turned against migrants, particularly in the wake of the 2015 refugee crisis—a situation for which Merkel admitted she was unprepared. Taking responsibility for the electoral results, she recognized the ramifications of her decisions during that turbulent period.

The rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, known for its strong anti-migrant stance, has further complicated the political atmosphere. Merkel's regrets regarding her earlier policies are evident, yet she has been cautious about implementing substantial changes. While she acknowledges the need for a reevaluation of her approach, her reluctance to make significant policy alterations suggests that any potential shifts may be more about optics than genuine reform.

Amidst the electoral fallout, Merkel firmly rejected proposals from the Christian Social Union (CSU) to cap the number of annual migrants at 200,000 and to prioritize Christian migrants over their Muslim counterparts. She argued that such discrimination against Muslim asylum seekers is fundamentally at odds with the principles of her party and the core values of Germany. This stance underscores her commitment to maintaining a more inclusive policy amid rising tensions.

The CSU's leadership has expressed frustration with Merkel's position on migration, with threats to withdraw support for her in the upcoming 2017 campaign if her approach does not align with their demands. This internal party conflict highlights the growing divide within Merkel's coalition, as her allies grapple with the challenges posed by a shifting electorate.

The current anti-migrant atmosphere is linked to broader concerns regarding terrorism and crime associated with incoming refugees, issues that have been amplified in public discourse. As these fears resonate with voters, Merkel may find herself facing significant challenges in the upcoming federal election, as discontent with her policies continues to simmer.

As the political landscape evolves, Merkel's reflections on her past decisions and her cautious approach to future policies will be closely scrutinized. The interplay between her leadership and the rising tide of anti-migrant sentiment will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of German politics in the coming months. 

With the CDU's recent electoral defeat serving as a wake-up call, Merkel's administration may need to navigate a delicate balance between upholding party principles and addressing the concerns of an increasingly wary electorate. As the nation grapples with the complexities of migration and integration, the implications of Merkel's decisions will reverberate beyond the immediate political context, influencing the broader discourse on refugees and national identity in Germany.",-14.0,-13.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,573.0,-0.6842105263157895,-0.02268760907504363
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

In a troubling case that has raised significant concerns within the community, Abdullah, a Somali Muslim asylum seeker residing in Sundsvall, Sweden, has been implicated in a violent incident involving his pregnant wife. Abdullah, who has a history of multiple convictions for violent crimes, assaults, and molestations, has been living off welfare benefits since arriving in Sweden five years ago.

The incident unfolded after Abdullah returned home from a night out with friends to discover that his wife’s niece was still at their residence, despite his explicit demand for her to leave. In a fit of rage over what he perceived as disobedience, Abdullah physically assaulted his wife, delivering kicks to her head and stomach. This brutal act of violence has sparked outrage and condemnation from various sectors of the community.

In an additional display of humiliation, Abdullah poured beer on his wife and urinated on her, actions that have further shocked observers and raised questions about the treatment of women in such domestic situations. The incident not only highlights the severity of domestic violence but also brings to light the troubling attitudes that can exist within certain cultural contexts.

The situation has drawn attention to a specific verse from the Quran (4:34) that discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. This reference has led to discussions about the selective adherence to Islamic teachings, as many critics argue that Abdullah's actions contradict the core principles of compassion and respect that are central to the faith. The juxtaposition of his violent behavior with religious teachings has prompted a broader conversation about the interpretation and application of such verses in contemporary society.

Critics have pointed out the dangers of using religious texts to justify abusive behavior, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced understanding of faith that aligns with modern values of equality and respect for all individuals. Abdullah's case serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding cultural integration, religious interpretation, and the urgent need for effective support systems for victims of domestic violence.

As the community grapples with the implications of this incident, local organizations and advocates are calling for increased awareness and education regarding domestic violence. They stress the importance of providing resources for victims and promoting healthy relationship dynamics that are rooted in mutual respect and understanding.

The fallout from Abdullah's actions has sparked a dialogue that extends beyond personal accountability, touching on societal attitudes towards violence and the role of cultural and religious influences in shaping behaviors. As Sundsvall continues to confront the realities of domestic violence, the hope remains that this incident will catalyze meaningful change and foster a safer environment for all individuals, regardless of their background.

The case against Abdullah is ongoing, and as it unfolds, the community watches closely, eager for justice and a reaffirmation of the values that promote safety and dignity for all.",-28.0,-31.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,532.0,-1.8235294117647058,-0.05827067669172932
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has sparked significant controversy, Pennsylvania Republicans are advancing House Bill 29, a piece of legislation that would permit non-residents to observe polling places and challenge voters on Election Day. Proponents of the bill argue that it is necessary to ensure electoral integrity, but critics warn that it could lead to widespread voter intimidation and disrupt the voting process.

The proposed legislation would allow individuals who do not reside in Pennsylvania to challenge the eligibility of voters at polling stations. This provision raises concerns among civil rights advocates who fear that it could open the door to discriminatory practices. Critics highlight the potential for challenges to be disproportionately aimed at voters based on their race or religion, which could undermine the democratic process and disenfranchise vulnerable populations.

Adam Gitlin, a representative from the Brennan Center for Justice, has voiced strong opposition to House Bill 29, noting that the presence of non-residents at polling places could create longer lines and discourage voter turnout. Gitlin's concerns reflect a growing anxiety that the bill could foster an environment of fear and intimidation, which may deter citizens from exercising their right to vote.

The bill's trajectory has gained additional attention due to comments made by former President Donald Trump, who has called on his supporters to monitor polling places in Pennsylvania. Trump has repeatedly claimed that election fraud could lead to his defeat, further fueling tensions around the upcoming election. His encouragement of poll monitoring has raised alarms among advocates for voting rights, who fear that it could incite aggressive challenges against voters.

In a significant aspect of the proposed legislation, an amendment has been introduced that would make the bill effective immediately upon passage, rather than the standard 60-day waiting period. This change could expedite the implementation of the bill, potentially impacting the upcoming election cycle in Pennsylvania. If passed, House Bill 29 could set a troubling precedent, not just in Pennsylvania but also for similar legislative efforts in other states.

The implications of this bill are profound, as the ability for non-residents to challenge voters could fundamentally alter the dynamics of Election Day. Observers worry that the introduction of such measures could lead to an atmosphere of hostility at polling places, where eligible voters may feel threatened or unwelcome. This raises critical questions about the integrity of the electoral process and the fundamental rights of citizens to participate freely in democracy.

As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how lawmakers will respond to the mounting criticism of House Bill 29. Advocates for voting rights are mobilizing to oppose the legislation, emphasizing the importance of protecting the right to vote without fear of intimidation or harassment. The outcome of this legislative effort could have lasting consequences for the electoral landscape in Pennsylvania and beyond.

In conclusion, the push for House Bill 29 by Pennsylvania Republicans has ignited a fierce debate about voter intimidation and the safeguarding of democratic principles. With the potential to disrupt the voting process and disproportionately affect marginalized communities, the bill's passage could reshape the electoral landscape in the state and set a concerning precedent for similar measures across the nation. As Election Day approaches, the stakes are high, and the eyes of both supporters and opponents of the bill remain fixed on Pennsylvania.",-19.0,-36.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,613.0,-1.6363636363636365,-0.05872756933115824

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, renowned for being the first athlete to compete in the Olympics wearing a hijab, has opened up about her feelings of insecurity while living in the United States. Despite her groundbreaking achievements, Muhammad has faced unsettling experiences that have left her questioning her safety and acceptance in her own country.

In a recent recounting of a troubling incident, Muhammad shared how someone followed her home in New York City, attempting to report her to the police. This experience highlights the pervasive issues of racism and discrimination that many individuals face, even in urban environments that are often considered more progressive. Muhammad’s story serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that people of color, particularly those who are also part of religious minorities, encounter daily.

While Muhammad's experiences are disheartening, she is quick to clarify that her encounters with racism pale in comparison to more severe incidents, such as the tragic shooting in North Carolina and the negative rhetoric directed at the Khan family during the Democratic National Convention. Her acknowledgment of these more severe issues underscores a complex landscape of discrimination, where various forms of bias intersect in troubling ways.

The discussion surrounding Muhammad's feelings also raises questions about the characterization of America as an ""Islamophobic"" country. Notably, statistics reveal that hate crime rates against Jews are higher than those against Muslims, prompting a deeper examination of the nuances within the broader conversation about race and religion in America.

In light of her concerns, some have suggested that if Muhammad finds America to be so intolerable, she might consider relocating to a Muslim-majority country, where conditions could potentially be worse. However, this perspective overlooks the freedoms and opportunities that Muhammad enjoys in America, which are not universally available in many Muslim countries.

As Ibtihaj Muhammad continues to navigate her identity as a Muslim woman and an athlete in the U.S., her experiences spark vital conversations about race, safety, and the complexities of belonging in a diverse society.",-23.0,-20.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,384.0,-1.6666666666666667,-0.052083333333333336
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

In the wake of a shooting incident involving a black police officer and a black suspect, protests in Charlotte have tragically escalated into riots, marking a troubling turn in the community’s response to such events. What began as a demonstration has devolved into chaos, revealing a disturbing undercurrent of disrespect and a lack of accountability among those involved.

The scenes unfolding in the streets of Charlotte were nothing short of alarming. Eyewitness accounts describe rioters laughing and mocking an injured police officer, an act that starkly illustrates a profound disrespect for law enforcement and the very fabric of societal order. This behavior raises serious questions about the values held by those participating in the riots, as they seem to prioritize chaos over constructive dialogue.

Critics of the protesters have not held back in their assessment, labeling them as ""thugs"" and attributing their actions to a troubling lack of responsibility. The characterization of the rioters as opportunists rather than individuals genuinely concerned for the welfare of black lives underscores a growing sentiment among observers. It appears that the motivations driving these riots are less about advocating for justice and more about seizing the moment for personal gain and reckless abandon.

The actions of those involved in the riots have sparked outrage, particularly among those who believe in the importance of peaceful protest and constructive engagement. The wave of violence and destruction has overshadowed the legitimate grievances that many in the black community have regarding systemic issues. Instead of fostering understanding and dialogue, the riots have created a chasm that further divides communities and undermines the pursuit of justice.

Moreover, the article takes a firm stance against supporters of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, accusing them of perpetuating violence and criminal behavior. This perspective suggests that the actions of a few have cast a long shadow over the entire movement, leading to a broader narrative that reflects poorly on the black community as a whole. The implications of such a viewpoint can be damaging, as it risks generalizing the actions of a subset of individuals to an entire population.

In a society that prides itself on the principle of judging individuals by their actions rather than their race, the rioting in Charlotte serves as a harsh reminder of the challenges that remain. The author expresses strong negative feelings towards the BLM movement, arguing that its supporters have strayed from the path of peaceful advocacy and instead have engaged in behavior that contradicts the very principles they claim to uphold.

The escalating violence in Charlotte raises critical questions about the future of protest movements and the means by which communities address grievances. As tensions rise, the need for responsible dialogue and respectful engagement becomes ever more pressing. The actions of those who have taken to the streets in anger have not only drawn criticism but have also sparked a broader conversation about the values that underpin society.

In conclusion, the riots in Charlotte following the shooting incident reveal a troubling dynamic within the community. The lack of respect for law enforcement, coupled with the opportunistic motivations of the rioters, paints a grim picture of the current state of protest movements. As society grapples with these issues, it is essential to foster a culture of accountability and respect, ensuring that the voices of those advocating for justice are not drowned out by the actions of a few. The path forward must prioritize constructive engagement over chaos, allowing for genuine dialogue that can lead to meaningful change.",-83.0,-76.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,650.0,-3.3043478260869565,-0.11692307692307692
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In a speech that has ignited significant debate, former President Barack Obama characterized himself as a far-left, borderline socialist progressive liberal, drawing criticism for a range of policies he championed during his administration. Among the most contentious of these are the Affordable Care Act, gun control measures, and an increase in refugee acceptance.

During his final address at the United Nations General Assembly, Obama articulated controversial views regarding the concept of American freedom, suggesting that the United States may need to sacrifice certain liberties in favor of a one-world order. He argued that global security is intrinsically linked to the strength of international institutions, particularly the United Nations, which he believes are crucial in addressing global challenges.

In a striking assertion, Obama stated that the only freedom that should remain inviolable is the right to self-defense. This declaration has drawn sharp criticism from various quarters, with many Americans expressing concern over his stance on personal liberties and national sovereignty. Despite the backlash, Obama remained steadfast in his position, acknowledging the criticism while asserting the necessity of his views in the context of an increasingly interconnected world.

The article portrays Obama as exhibiting a degree of arrogance and an unwillingness to compromise, a sentiment that reflects the growing divisiveness in Washington D.C. His remarks at the UN have further fueled the ongoing debate over the balance between national interests and global cooperation, leaving many to question the implications of his vision for America's role on the world stage.

As the nation grapples with the fallout from his speech, it remains clear that Obama’s legacy continues to evoke strong reactions, underscoring the polarized political climate in the United States. The implications of his call for a more integrated global governance structure are likely to resonate for years to come, as discussions around freedom, security, and international collaboration remain at the forefront of American political discourse.",13.0,22.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,360.0,2.2,0.06111111111111111
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the world of professional football, Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have both found themselves on the sidelines, not starting quarterbacks in the NFL. However, the narratives surrounding these two athletes could not be more different. Tebow is portrayed as a respected figure, while Kaepernick is criticized for his perceived disrespectful actions.

Tebow, known for his strong moral compass and commitment to his beliefs, recently commented on Kaepernick's controversial National Anthem protest. He emphasized the importance of standing for one’s beliefs “the right way,” suggesting that there are appropriate avenues for expressing dissent. This sentiment reflects a broader belief that while everyone is entitled to their opinions, the manner in which those opinions are expressed can significantly impact public perception.

Conversely, Kaepernick's protest during the National Anthem has drawn significant criticism. Some argue that he should seek to express his views outside of the football arena, where the focus is intended to be on the game itself. The article suggests that such protests can detract from the spirit of sportsmanship and unity that sports are meant to embody.

The author of the article goes further, asserting that claims of oppression in the U.S. are unfounded. They argue that no one in the country is truly oppressed, positing that such claims are often excuses for laziness. This perspective is exemplified by the mention of Barack Obama, who achieved significant success without resorting to claims of oppression. The comparison serves to highlight the belief that perseverance and hard work can lead to success, regardless of one’s background.

In a controversial twist, the article also discusses affirmative action, labeling it as a form of oppression for others. This assertion adds another layer to the ongoing debate about equality and opportunity in America, suggesting that policies intended to uplift certain groups may inadvertently disadvantage others.

Amidst this discourse, Tebow emerges as a figure who has smartly navigated the complexities of public life. By avoiding negative press and focusing on his career, he has maintained a positive image that resonates with many fans. His dedication to his craft and his ability to remain above the fray are seen as attributes that will serve him well as he continues his journey, now with the New York Mets.

As the article concludes, there is a hopeful sentiment for Tebow's success in baseball. His transition from football to baseball has been met with curiosity and support, and many are eager to see how he will fare in this new chapter of his athletic career. In a landscape marked by division, Tebow stands as a symbol of respect and determination, while Kaepernick's approach continues to spark debate about the intersection of sports and social issues.",-6.0,9.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,514.0,0.42857142857142855,0.017509727626459144
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

As debates surrounding immigration policy continue to dominate the national conversation, the issue of border security has emerged as a critical measure not only for controlling illegal immigration but also for safeguarding national security. The U.S.-Mexico border wall has been positioned as a vital component of this strategy, reminiscent of historical defenses such as China's Great Wall, which was constructed to fend off foreign invaders rather than to restrict the movement of people.

In recent years, Mexico has seen increasing control by drug cartels, leading to a surge in violence and a staggering death toll. This instability raises alarms about the potential for terrorist organizations, including ISIS, to exploit the vulnerabilities of an unsecured Southern Border. The threat is not merely theoretical; in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally cross into the United States from Mexico, highlighting the pressing security concerns.

Federal agents intercepted these individuals at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, a critical point of entry that has become a focal point for border security. Hector Garza, President of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2455, confirmed the reports of Syrians attempting to cross but noted that he could not disclose specific incidents due to security protocols. This incident underscores the ongoing challenges faced by border enforcement agents in maintaining security amidst limited resources.

Garza further revealed a concerning statistic: eight out of ten individuals caught attempting to enter the U.S. illegally are not deported and are allowed to remain in the country. This situation raises questions about the effectiveness of current border policies and the ability of law enforcement to manage the influx of individuals crossing the border.

The challenges faced by Border Patrol agents are compounded by resource limitations, making it increasingly difficult to enforce immigration laws and protect national security. As the country grapples with these issues, there is a growing emphasis on the need for stronger border security measures.

Support is gathering for presidential candidates who advocate for enhanced border security, reflecting a public desire for policies that prioritize national safety. As the dialogue continues, the importance of a fortified border remains clear—not just as a deterrent to illegal immigration, but as a necessary safeguard against potential threats to the nation.",-13.0,-20.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,423.0,-1.4285714285714286,-0.04728132387706856

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

In a recent gathering, a vibrant crowd of Haitians expressed their enthusiastic support for former President Donald Trump, sharing personal stories that highlighted their positive experiences during his administration. The atmosphere was charged with energy as attendees cheered for Trump, fostering a sense of community and solidarity.

Throughout the event, the audience voiced strong dissatisfaction with the Clintons, particularly concerning their handling of aid for Haiti. Many attendees claimed that after receiving substantial funds intended for the impoverished nation, the Clintons seemingly vanished from the scene. Accusations emerged that financial resources meant for Haiti were diverted to Washington lobbyists, raising concerns about accountability and transparency.

The crowd directed pointed criticism at Hillary Clinton, alleging that she actively blocked an increase in Haiti's daily minimum wage from $3 to $5. This claim resonated strongly among the audience, who felt that such actions contributed to ongoing economic struggles in their homeland.

Interestingly, media representatives present at the event departed early, seemingly unable to find a newsworthy angle amidst the audience's vocal criticism of Hillary Clinton and their enthusiastic praise for Trump. This early exit has led to suggestions of media bias, as it appears the sentiments of the audience were overlooked in favor of more traditional narratives.

The event underscored a significant disconnect between the political sentiments of this group of Haitians and the broader media portrayal of the political landscape, highlighting the complexities of voter sentiment and the influence of past administrations on current perceptions.",-2.0,8.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,283.0,0.8,0.028268551236749116
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a climate of increasing concerns over national security and integration, a recent poll has revealed a significant shift in Australian public opinion regarding Muslim immigration. The survey indicates that 49% of Australians now support a ban on Muslim immigration until adequate safety measures are established. This figure marks a notable increase from just 28% last October, suggesting a growing unease among the populace about the implications of Muslim migration.

The debate over immigration policy has intensified, particularly following controversial statements made by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who proposed a similar ban on Muslim immigration. Trump's proposal was met with fierce criticism from Democrats, who labeled it as racist. However, it is essential to clarify that racism typically relates to beliefs about racial superiority, while Islam is a religion, not a race. This distinction is pivotal in understanding the motivations behind the rising support for immigration restrictions.

Critics of Islam point to its perceived susceptibility to radicalization as a significant concern. Instances of violence associated with radical Islamic groups have further fueled apprehensions among the public. The fear of terrorism and its potential impact on Australian society has become a driving force behind the call for stricter immigration policies. Supporters of the ban cite these issues as primary reasons for their stance, underscoring a desire for enhanced security and a more cohesive societal integration.

The poll also reveals that 48% of voters are in favor of initiating a national debate on immigration, indicating a willingness to engage in discussions about the complexities of the issue. Notably, two-thirds of Australians believe that populist senator Pauline Hanson effectively addresses topics that other politicians often avoid. This sentiment reflects a growing appetite for candid conversations surrounding immigration and its implications for Australian society.

Breaking down the support for a ban on Muslim immigration further illustrates its widespread appeal across the political spectrum. Approximately 60% of right-wing Coalition voters endorse the ban, alongside 40% of Labour voters and 34% of Green voters. This cross-party support underscores the notion that concerns about immigration and national security transcend traditional political affiliations.

The pollster behind this survey expressed surprise at the significant backing for the ban, suggesting that it reflects a substantial portion of the Australian population. As discussions around immigration continue to evolve, it is crucial for political leaders to acknowledge these sentiments rather than dismiss opposing views outright. The article criticizes figures like Hillary Clinton for failing to recognize the concerns of a considerable segment of the population, advocating instead for a more inclusive dialogue that addresses the realities faced by many Australians.

In light of these findings, it is evident that the conversation surrounding Muslim immigration in Australia is far from settled. The rising support for a ban, coupled with a desire for a national debate, highlights the importance of addressing the fears and concerns of citizens. As the nation grapples with issues of safety, integration, and national identity, the call for a thorough examination of immigration policies remains a pressing matter for both political leaders and the electorate.

As Australia moves forward, the challenge will be to balance the need for security with the values of inclusivity and diversity that define the nation. Engaging in open and honest discussions about immigration may pave the way for more effective policies that reflect the concerns of the public while upholding the principles of a fair and just society.",2.0,11.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,632.0,0.44,0.01740506329113924

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",http://freedomdaily.com/white-men-set-on-fire-by-blacks-media-censored/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/whites-on-fire.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a shocking turn of events, a street altercation escalated into a horrifying scene when an individual set participants on fire, leading to chaos and panic among bystanders. The incident, which was anticipated to be merely a fight, took a deadly twist that left the community reeling.

Witnesses described the atmosphere as chaotic, with people fleeing the scene in fear of being struck by oncoming vehicles. The unexpected use of fire as a weapon stunned those present, raising questions about the mindset of the assailant who threw the Molotov cocktail. The author of a recent article expressed disbelief at the premeditated nature of such an act, pondering how someone could resort to such extreme violence in a public setting.

This incident has sparked a broader conversation about societal behavior and the shifts in community response to violence. In earlier times, individuals might have instinctively intervened to protect those in danger. However, the current trend often leans towards recording events on smartphones rather than stepping in to help. This shift raises critical questions about the values that guide our actions and the level of empathy we extend to others.

In light of this tragic event, there is a pressing call to action for individuals to cultivate a greater sense of care and responsibility towards one another. The normalization of violence in society is alarming, and it is imperative that communities come together to reject such behaviors. Encouraging compassion and active intervention can help create a safer environment for everyone.

As the investigation into the incident continues, it is essential for community members to reflect on their roles in preventing violence and fostering a culture of support. The shocking nature of this event serves as a reminder of the potential consequences of inaction and the importance of prioritizing human life over the allure of sensationalism. 

In a world where violence can erupt unexpectedly, it is crucial to remember that each individual has the power to make a difference.

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- A border wall is deemed necessary not only to prevent illegal immigration but also to secure access points into America.

In light of recent events, the necessity for a border wall has gained renewed emphasis, underscoring its role not only in preventing illegal immigration but also in securing access points into the United States. Law enforcement officials in Luna County, New Mexico, are on heightened alert after a traffic stop involving an undocumented Middle Eastern woman who had plans concerning a nearby gas pipeline.

The woman, identified as an “Islamic refugee,” was found with detailed plans for a gas pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. This discovery has raised significant concerns regarding potential terrorist intentions, prompting an investigation by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and the U.S. Border Patrol. Fortunately, authorities reported finding no immediate threats linked to the incident.

The remote nature of the pipeline's location has led to speculation that the woman may have been scouting for future attacks rather than plotting an immediate one. This has further intensified concerns regarding the presence of an undocumented Muslim woman in a border county, particularly in light of past reports indicating collaboration between Mexican cartels and terrorist organizations. 

Judicial Watch has documented instances from 2015 and 2017 where Mexican gangs were implicated in smuggling individuals from terror-prone nations into the U.S., and there have been accounts of Islamic terror groups crossing the border to scout for potential targets. These reports have fueled fears that the southern border remains a vulnerable entry point for both terrorists and drug cartels.

As discussions surrounding border security continue, there are increasing calls for Congress to approve funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall. Advocates argue that the wall is essential for safeguarding the southern border against foreign threats. The argument is bolstered by the observation that many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. are not solely from Mexico; rather, they often traverse the country to reach the American-Mexican border, sometimes with assistance from the Mexican government.

The recent incident in Luna County serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with unsecured borders. The possibility of a terrorist entering the U.S. through the southern border is a pressing concern that highlights the urgent need for enhanced security measures, including the construction of a border wall. As the nation grapples with these challenges, the call for comprehensive border security remains critical.",-44.0,-29.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,429.0,-1.9333333333333333,-0.0675990675990676

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In an era where public figures often grapple with the pressures of fame and the expectations that come with it, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson stands out as a committed advocate for faith and positive living. Wilson has made it his mission not only to excel on the football field but also to share his love for God and inspire others to pursue a life filled with joy and peace.

At the core of Wilson's philosophy is a simple yet profound prioritization of his life. He places his relationship with God at the forefront, followed closely by his family and friends, with football coming in third. This hierarchy, he believes, is essential in leading a fulfilling and balanced life. Wilson asserts that maintaining these priorities fosters positive outcomes and significantly reduces stress, a sentiment that resonates with many who seek to navigate the challenges of modern life.

Despite the NFL's advisories suggesting that he refrain from discussing his faith publicly, Wilson remains steadfast in expressing his beliefs. He chooses to embody his faith through his actions, demonstrating that true commitment to one's values can shine through, regardless of external pressures. His dedication to living a life of integrity and purpose serves as a testament to the power of faith in shaping character and influencing others positively.

However, Wilson's unwavering commitment to his beliefs raises important questions about the broader landscape of public figures and their responsibilities. The article critiques the perceived hypocrisy of those in positions of influence who seem to forget their roots and neglect the opportunity to use their platforms for good. In a time when society craves authenticity, the failure of some leaders to uphold their values can lead to disillusionment among their followers.

This concern is particularly poignant in the current political climate, where corruption and deception appear to permeate leadership at various levels. The article highlights the growing unease surrounding those who prioritize personal gain over the well-being of the community. As public trust wanes, the call for leaders to act with integrity and serve their constituents becomes increasingly urgent.

Moreover, the author questions the societal shift that has led to a perception that serving others and promoting happiness is viewed negatively. In a world where self-interest often takes precedence, the values of altruism and community service seem to be overshadowed. This trend raises alarms about the moral compass of society and the potential consequences of neglecting the principles of kindness and compassion.

As Wilson continues to navigate his career, he embodies the notion that truth and righteousness are essential virtues that should guide one's actions. The article suggests that these values are under attack, particularly in discussions around tolerance and moral clarity. In a landscape where differing opinions often lead to division, Wilson's approach serves as a reminder that faith, hope, and love can unite rather than divide.

In conclusion, Russell Wilson's commitment to sharing his faith and inspiring others offers a refreshing perspective in the world of professional sports and beyond. His prioritization of God, family, and football reflects a deep-seated belief that true fulfillment comes from serving others and making positive choices. As he continues to shine as a beacon of integrity, Wilson challenges us all to reflect on our values and the impact we can have in our communities. In doing so, he not only uplifts his teammates and fans but also encourages a broader conversation about the importance of living a life rooted in truth and compassion.",79.0,88.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,649.0,3.52,0.13559322033898305
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a recent address in Italy, Pope Francis delivered a pointed critique of fear-based media, equating its impact to that of terrorism. The Pope's comments come at a time when concerns regarding nationalism and the role of media in shaping public perception have become increasingly relevant.

During his remarks, Pope Francis emphasized the destructive nature of journalism that relies on gossip or rumors. He argued that such practices not only misinform the public but can also cause significant harm to individuals and communities. The Pope's condemnation of sensationalist reporting underscores a growing concern about the ethical responsibilities of journalists in an age dominated by rapid information dissemination.

Referencing a well-known quote by Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Pope suggested that the media often cultivates unnecessary fear among the populace. ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,"" he reminded his audience, implying that the media's portrayal of crime and terrorism can exacerbate public anxiety. Despite statistics indicating a decline in crime rates, many Americans report feeling increasingly fearful of both terrorism and crime, a sentiment that the Pope finds troubling.

Recent polls have highlighted this rising tide of fear among Americans, with growing concerns specifically surrounding mass shootings and public protests. The Pope's observations resonate with these findings, as he pointed out that the pervasive atmosphere of fear can lead to a distorted view of reality, one that is not necessarily reflective of the actual circumstances on the ground.

Critics have pointed to specific media outlets, such as Fox News, as significant contributors to this culture of fear. The network's approach to reporting has been characterized by a focus on sensationalism and alarmist narratives, which many argue shapes public perception and influences political discourse. This phenomenon has been particularly evident in the rhetoric employed by prominent political figures, including former President Donald Trump, whose messaging often mirrors the fear-driven narratives propagated by certain media outlets.

The Pope's remarks serve as a call to action for journalists and media consumers alike. He advocates for a more responsible and ethical approach to news reporting—one that prioritizes truth over sensationalism and seeks to inform rather than incite fear. In an era where misinformation can spread rapidly, Pope Francis's message is a timely reminder of the profound impact that media can have on societal perceptions and individual lives.

As discussions around nationalism and media ethics continue to unfold, the Pope's insights may encourage a reevaluation of how news is reported and consumed, fostering a more informed and less fearful public discourse.",-56.0,-42.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,478.0,-2.4705882352941178,-0.08786610878661087
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We all must wait and

Key topics during the debate included the Birther movement, Clinton's email controversy, and Trump's tax returns, all of which sparked heated exchanges between the candidates. While CNN's polling indicated a clear lead for Clinton, concerns arose regarding the sample group, which some critics claimed leaned Democratic. Despite Clinton's apparent victory in this particular poll, many voters expressed mixed feelings about its potential impact on their decisions in the upcoming election.

Trump took to Twitter to express gratitude to his supporters for their favorable polling results, emphasizing his belief that he resonated more with the electorate. Meanwhile, Clinton has remained silent on the polling outcomes, which has led to speculation about her campaign's strategy moving forward.

In a post-debate critique, Trump raised issues with the debate conditions, claiming he experienced audio difficulties with a defective microphone. He also suggested that he missed an opportunity to address Bill Clinton's infidelity, which he believed could have altered the debate's dynamics.

As the election date draws closer, both candidates face a pressing timeline to influence undecided voters. The stakes are high, and each debate and public appearance could be pivotal in swaying public opinion.

Adding to the intrigue, Julian Assange hinted at a potential ""October surprise"" release on Wikileaks that could have significant implications for Clinton's campaign. With the political landscape constantly shifting, both candidates are acutely aware that every moment counts as they strive to secure voter support in a heated electoral race.",18.0,6.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,367.0,0.42857142857142855,0.01634877384196185

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

Post-debate polls suggest that Hillary Clinton emerged victorious against Donald Trump in their latest face-off. Focus groups from major news outlets indicate a significant advantage for Clinton, with CNN reporting an 18-2 victory and Fox News showing a 16-6 lead in favor of the former Secretary of State. 

CNN's focus group comprised voters from Florida, while Fox News gathered participants from Pennsylvania, both key battleground states in the upcoming election. These findings reflect a strong performance by Clinton, particularly in areas where her policies resonate with voters.

Political analyst Frank Luntz observed that Trump faced challenges when responding to questions about his taxes. However, he noted that Trump showed improvement when the conversation shifted to Clinton's email scandal, suggesting a strategic pivot in his debate tactics. Conversely, Trump struggled to effectively address his previous comments regarding President Obama's birthplace, which may have further hindered his performance in the eyes of voters.

Despite the favorable focus group results for Clinton, a separate poll conducted by Drudge revealed a strikingly different narrative, with Trump reportedly winning 92% to 8%. This discrepancy highlights the polarized views of the electorate and raises questions about the effectiveness of debate performances in swaying public opinion.

Following the debate, Clinton took to Twitter to declare her victory, prompting the emergence of the trending hashtag #TrumpWon. This social media phenomenon reflects a vocal segment of the population that challenges Clinton's assertion of victory, as critics on Twitter emphasized her avoidance of media interactions and questioned the legitimacy of her claims.

As the election approaches, the contrasting narratives from focus groups and social media underscore the complex dynamics at play. While Clinton may have gained ground in traditional polling metrics, the fervent discussions online reveal that opinions remain deeply divided, setting the stage for an intense electoral battle ahead.",18.0,27.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,353.0,2.076923076923077,0.0764872521246459
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC – Protests erupted in Charlotte for the second consecutive night, igniting tensions in the community following the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. The demonstrations, which began peacefully, quickly escalated into chaos when a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured during the unrest. The circumstances surrounding the shooting have become a focal point of contention, with conflicting narratives emerging regarding who was responsible.

The protests commenced with demonstrators gathering at the Omni Hotel, where they chanted “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” expressing their outrage over Scott’s death. Scott, a 31-year-old Black man, was reportedly shot by police during an encounter that has since drawn widespread condemnation and calls for accountability. As the night progressed, the atmosphere shifted dramatically when riot police arrived on the scene, leading to heightened tensions and confrontations.

Eyewitness accounts have raised serious questions about the official narrative provided by law enforcement. Initial reports from the police claimed that the shooting incident involved a civilian shooter, asserting that the injured individual was a victim of civilian-on-civilian violence. However, many witnesses have contested this assertion, suggesting that police may have been involved in the shooting.

Todd Zimmer, an eyewitness, took to Twitter to voice his concerns about the incident, stating, “The city is lying about what happened here.” Zimmer’s comments echo a growing sentiment among protesters who believe that the police are attempting to deflect responsibility for the violence that erupted during the demonstrations.

Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer and another eyewitness, also challenged the police narrative, asserting that the shooting was not the result of civilian actions. Meyer’s perspective adds to the chorus of voices calling for a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the shooting and the police’s response during the protests.

As the night unfolded, eyewitnesses reported that the atmosphere had shifted from peaceful demonstration to chaos. The sound of a gunshot pierced the air, described by many as significantly louder than a typical firearm discharge. This detail has further fueled suspicions regarding police involvement, as observers noted that the response from law enforcement seemed disproportionate to the situation at hand.

In the wake of the shooting, police deployed tear gas on the retreating crowd of peaceful protesters. This aggressive tactic has drawn criticism from community leaders and activists who argue that the police response only exacerbated the already volatile situation. Eyewitnesses reported a chaotic scene, with a protester lying injured on the ground while police appeared to fail in their duty to provide assistance.

As the protests continued into the night, observers noted a stark contrast between the initial intentions of the demonstrators and the unfolding events. The peaceful gathering, which sought to honor Kenneth L. Scott and advocate for justice, was marred by violence and confusion. The conflicting accounts of the shooting have left many in the community feeling unsettled and distrustful of law enforcement.

The City of Charlotte was quick to respond to the shooting incident, taking to Twitter to assert that it was a civilian-on-civilian shooting and denying any police involvement. This statement has been met with skepticism by many who witnessed the events unfold, further fueling the anger and frustration among protesters.

Additional eyewitness reports, including statements from clergy members present at the scene, have contradicted the police narrative. These accounts suggest that the police may have played a role in the shooting, leading to calls for an independent investigation into the incident. The clergy, who have often served as mediators during protests, expressed their concern for the safety of the community and the need for accountability.

As the protests continue, community leaders are urging for calm and dialogue, while also emphasizing the importance of justice for Kenneth L. Scott. The events of the past two nights have reignited discussions about police violence and accountability, with many calling for systemic changes to prevent such tragedies in the future.

The situation in Charlotte remains fluid, with demonstrators vowing to continue their protests until justice is served. As the community grapples with the aftermath of the police killing and the subsequent violence, the demand for transparency and accountability from law enforcement is louder than ever.

In the days ahead, it will be crucial for city officials and law enforcement to address the concerns raised by the community and provide clarity regarding the events that transpired during the protests. The need for an honest dialogue about police practices and community relations has never been more urgent, as the city of Charlotte stands at a crossroads in its pursuit of justice and healing.

The protests, fueled by grief and anger, reflect a broader national conversation about police violence and the treatment of marginalized communities. As the situation develops, the eyes of the nation will be on Charlotte, watching to see how city leaders respond to the demands of their constituents and whether meaningful change will emerge from this tragic incident.

In the meantime, the injured protester remains in critical condition, and the community is left grappling with the aftermath of a night that began with calls for justice but ended in chaos and confusion. As the protests continue, the call for accountability and truth remains at the forefront of the demonstrators' demands, echoing the sentiments of countless others across the country who seek an end to police violence and systemic injustice. 

The events in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle for justice and equality, and the need for communities to come together in the face of adversity. As the city navigates this turbulent moment, the voices of the people will undoubtedly shape the future of their community and its relationship with law enforcement. 

With the protests set to continue, the question remains: will the city of Charlotte acknowledge the voices of its citizens and take meaningful steps toward reform, or will the cycle of violence and mistrust persist? Only time will tell, but for now, the community stands united in its demand for justice for Kenneth L. Scott and an end to the violence that has marred their city.",-74.0,-97.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,1133.0,-2.425,-0.08561341571050309
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the 2024 presidential campaign heats up, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, finds himself under scrutiny for his foreign policy stance, particularly regarding Russia. Critics have pointed out that Trump's approach appears to align closely with the interests of Vladimir Putin and the Russian government, raising alarms about his potential presidency and its implications for U.S. foreign relations.

Trump's connections to Russia have been a topic of discussion since his first campaign for the presidency in 2016. His associations with individuals linked to the Kremlin and Russian oligarchs have led many to question his motivations and the integrity of his foreign policy. Russian state-controlled media and intelligence services have openly supported Trump, and there are allegations of interference with Democratic Party communications, further complicating the narrative surrounding his candidacy.

Despite these concerns, Trump has publicly claimed to have no business ties to Russia, asserting, ""I have ZERO investments in Russia."" However, an investigation conducted by ABC News presents a stark contrast to this claim, revealing that Trump has ""numerous ties"" to Russian interests, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in business dealings. This discrepancy raises significant questions about the veracity of Trump's statements and the potential impact of his financial interests on his political decisions.

Among Trump's various business ventures, significant profits have been reported from dealings with Russian oligarchs. Notably, Trump hosted the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and has sold real estate to Russian buyers. These transactions have not only enriched Trump but have also drawn attention to the methods through which Russian oligarchs, who amassed their wealth during the transition to a free-market economy, have utilized their influence to support Putin while simultaneously benefiting themselves.

Critics argue that purchasing Trump properties has served as a means for Russian oligarchs to launder money, creating an intricate web of financial entanglements that could pose serious ethical dilemmas. Former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev has described these oligarchs as materialistic and culturally ignorant, further emphasizing the disconnect between their interests and the values typically associated with American leadership.

In 2014, the U.S. government imposed sanctions on Russian oligarchs to curb their ability to launder money and mitigate their influence. However, Trump has signaled that he might reconsider these sanctions if he returns to the presidency. This potential shift raises alarms about the implications for U.S. foreign policy and the extent to which Trump's personal financial interests could influence his decisions regarding Russia.

The intertwining of Trump's business dealings and his political ambitions has led to growing concerns about conflicts of interest. Critics argue that Trump's financial ties to Russia could compromise his ability to act in the best interests of the United States. The suggestion that Trump prioritizes his own interests over those of the nation has become a central theme in the ongoing discourse surrounding his candidacy.

As the election approaches, many are left wondering how Trump's connections to Russia could shape his foreign policy if he were to win the presidency. The potential for corruption and the influence of foreign interests on American governance have become pressing issues that voters must consider. The implications of allowing such connections to persist in the highest office in the land could have far-reaching consequences for U.S. national security and international relations.

In conclusion, Trump's foreign policy, characterized by apparent support for Putin and entanglements with Russian oligarchs, raises significant concerns as he campaigns for the presidency. The juxtaposition of his claims of having no business ties to Russia against evidence of extensive financial dealings underscores the complexities of his candidacy. As the electorate weighs these issues, the potential for conflicts of interest looms large, prompting a critical examination of what it means to prioritize the nation's interests in the face of personal gain.",27.0,23.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,707.0,0.92,0.03253182461103253
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is facing the prospect of impeachment as the fallout from the ""Bridgegate"" scandal continues to unfold. Top state legislators are actively considering the possibility of filing articles of impeachment if Christie is found guilty of orchestrating the controversial closures of the George Washington Bridge, allegedly as a means to punish a political rival.

The Bridgegate scandal, which erupted in 2013, involved the deliberate closure of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge, leading to severe traffic jams that caused significant disruptions. The situation escalated to the point where emergency services were delayed, resulting in at least one tragic death. As the scandal has progressed, federal prosecutors have recently implicated Christie during a trial involving his senior aides, further intensifying scrutiny on the governor's actions.

In a significant development, a judge has ordered Christie to produce personal emails related to the Bridgegate scandal, which could provide crucial evidence regarding his involvement and knowledge of the events that transpired. The decision to move forward with impeachment proceedings now rests with Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto. For impeachment to proceed, a majority vote from the 80-member Assembly is required, underscoring the political challenges ahead for Christie.

Should the Assembly choose to impeach Christie, the subsequent trial would be held in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority would be necessary for conviction. This multi-step process highlights the intricate dynamics of New Jersey's political landscape, as Christie navigates mounting pressure from both the public and political rivals.

Christie’s political career, once viewed as promising and potentially leading him to a prominent role within the Republican Party, has experienced a steep decline in light of the ongoing scandal. The governor previously denied any knowledge of the Bridgegate closures during a press conference in January 2014, shortly after the scandal first came to light. However, revelations have surfaced indicating that Christie was informed about the situation during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 but failed to take any action to address the matter.

The implications of the Bridgegate scandal extend beyond Christie’s personal accountability; they also affect his political alliances. Notably, Christie endorsed Donald Trump as the Republican presidential nominee and is currently serving as the chairperson of Trump’s transition team. This endorsement, once seen as a strategic move to bolster his own political standing, now appears to be overshadowed by the ongoing investigations and legal challenges he faces.

As the situation develops, New Jersey residents and political observers alike are closely monitoring the unfolding events. The potential for impeachment represents a critical juncture not only for Christie but also for the state’s political landscape. The outcome of the investigations, coupled with the actions of the state legislature, will undoubtedly shape the future of Christie's governorship and his standing within the Republican Party.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In the heated atmosphere of the September 2015 Republican primary debate, Donald Trump made a bold assertion regarding his past interactions with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Trump claimed he ""never lobbied"" Bush for casino gambling, stating emphatically that had he desired to do so, he would have succeeded. This statement, however, raises significant questions about the veracity of Trump's claims and whether he may have committed perjury.

The crux of the matter lies in a deposition taken in 2007, where Trump openly admitted to pushing for casino gambling in Florida. This stark contradiction between his debate statement and his previous acknowledgment of lobbying efforts suggests a deliberate attempt to obscure the truth. By denying any lobbying activity during the debate, Trump appeared to sidestep the reality of his failure to influence Bush on the gambling issue. This has led many observers to speculate that Trump was attempting to save face by altering the narrative to avoid admitting defeat.

During the same debate, Jeb Bush countered Trump's assertions with a firm rebuttal, asserting that Trump had indeed sought to influence him regarding casino gambling. Bush's response not only challenged Trump’s credibility but also highlighted the contentious relationship between the two political figures. The clash over this issue underscores the broader implications of political discourse and the accountability of candidates in their statements.

The significance of this debate exchange extends beyond mere political rivalry; it echoes historical precedents where the truthfulness of public figures has come under scrutiny. A notable comparison arises with the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, who faced severe consequences for lying under oath about personal matters. The parallels drawn between Clinton's situation and Trump's alleged misrepresentation raise critical questions about the integrity of public officials and the standards to which they should be held.

Furthermore, the article argues that Trump's propensity to distort the truth is not merely a matter of political strategy but poses a significant risk to national safety. When leaders manipulate facts or present false narratives, the consequences can ripple through society, affecting public trust and the overall functioning of democracy. The potential for misinformation to undermine national security is a pressing concern that warrants serious reflection.

To fully grasp the implications of Trump's statements, readers are encouraged to compare the transcripts from both the debate and the 2007 deposition. This exercise serves as a means to discern whether Trump committed perjury or simply lied on national television. The analysis of these documents could provide critical insights into the nature of Trump's claims and the potential ramifications of his words.

In light of these revelations, the article concludes with a clarion call for Congress to take action. The suggestion of impeachment is not made lightly; it reflects a growing sentiment that accountability is essential for maintaining the integrity of the office. As the nation grapples with issues of truth and trust, the need for decisive action becomes increasingly pressing.

In summary, the debate over Donald Trump's claims regarding casino gambling and his interactions with Jeb Bush highlights a broader concern about honesty in political discourse. The stark contrast between his statements in 2015 and his admissions in 2007 raises serious questions about the reliability of his assertions. As the public continues to navigate the complexities of political communication, the importance of transparency and accountability remains paramount. The call for impeachment serves as a reminder that the truth must prevail, not just for the sake of political rivalry, but for the health of the nation's democracy.",-29.0,-18.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,665.0,-0.6923076923076923,-0.02706766917293233
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers participated in a drinking game during a 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN.

In a unique twist to the political landscape, many viewers engaged in a drinking game during a recent 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN. However, this lighthearted approach to political discourse has raised serious concerns from health officials. 

U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a warning about the potential dangers of drinking whenever former President Donald Trump lies, suggesting that such behavior could lead to alcohol poisoning. This caution is particularly pertinent given Murthy's previous advisories regarding the risks associated with drinking games during political debates, especially with the current Republican candidates.

The Surgeon General's concerns are not unfounded. In 2012, there were approximately 70,000 reported incidents of alcohol poisoning linked to debate drinking games. This alarming statistic prompted Murthy to issue warnings in 2015, urging viewers to reconsider their drinking habits during politically charged events.

Ahead of the highly anticipated first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on September 26, 2016, Murthy reiterated the potential hazards of drinking in response to Trump's statements. His warnings were timely, as a study conducted by Politico revealed that Trump had told 87 lies over a five-day period from September 15 to September 20, averaging a lie every three minutes and 15 seconds. Based on this average, it is estimated that Trump likely told about 28 lies during the recent CNN debate.

In light of these statistics, Surgeon General Murthy advised viewers to exercise caution during future debates. He noted that first responders were preparing for potential alcohol-related incidents following the debate, underscoring the seriousness of the situation. 

As the political season heats up, viewers are reminded to drink responsibly, particularly when it comes to Trump's propensity for making false statements. The Surgeon General's warnings serve as a crucial reminder that while political debates can be engaging and entertaining, they can also pose significant health risks when combined with reckless drinking behavior. 

With the election season underway, it remains essential for viewers to prioritize their health and safety, ensuring that their engagement with political discourse does not come at the expense of their well-being.",-17.0,-15.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,394.0,-0.9375,-0.03807106598984772
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In the wake of the recent presidential debate, mainstream media outlets have widely declared Hillary Clinton the victor. However, the narrative diverges significantly in the realm of social media, where online polls and Twitter trends have painted a contrasting picture. The hashtag #TrumpWon surged in popularity, trending across the United States and capturing the attention of millions.

Interestingly, the origins of the hashtag have raised eyebrows. Reports indicate that #TrumpWon first emerged from St. Petersburg, Russia, a detail that has sparked discussions about the influence of foreign entities on American political discourse. Russian dictator Vladimir Putin is known for employing cyber-trolls as part of a broader strategy to promote disinformation campaigns aimed at creating discord and amplifying divisions within the U.S. This tactic appears to be a calculated effort to sway public opinion and manipulate the political landscape.

Putin's regime has a history of promoting Donald Trump to European audiences, a move believed to align with his goal of lifting economic sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs. The Kremlin's support for Trump raises questions about the authenticity of online sentiments that may be manufactured rather than organically expressed by American citizens.

The conditions under which these cyber-trolls operate have been likened to those of an ""internet sweat shop."" Former bloggers have shared insights into their experiences, describing harsh working environments where they faced fines for tardiness and were closely monitored by editors for ideological compliance. This raises significant concerns about the integrity of online discussions and the potential manipulation of public opinion through orchestrated campaigns.

As the debate continues over who truly won the night, experts caution against placing undue trust in online polls and engaging with trolls. The digital landscape is fraught with challenges, as misinformation can easily spread and distort perceptions of reality. The influence of foreign actors, particularly in the context of the upcoming election, underscores the need for vigilance among voters and a critical approach to information consumed through social media.

In conclusion, while mainstream media may have crowned Clinton the debate champion, the online narrative, fueled by foreign influence, suggests a more complex and potentially misleading picture. As the political climate heats up, it is imperative for the American public to remain discerning and aware of the forces that seek to shape their opinions from afar.",-9.0,10.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,439.0,0.5882352941176471,0.022779043280182234
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a prominent data analytics company led by Peter Thiel, is currently embroiled in a federal lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor. The lawsuit alleges that the company has systematically discriminated against Asian job applicants during its hiring process, raising significant concerns about its employment practices.

As a federal contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), Palantir is expected to adhere to strict non-discriminatory hiring standards. However, the lawsuit highlights troubling statistics regarding the company's hiring practices. Out of 130 applicants for engineering intern positions, a striking 73% were Asian. Yet, alarmingly, only four Asian candidates were hired compared to 17 non-Asian applicants. Such a disparity raises questions about the fairness and equity of Palantir's recruitment process.

Experts have estimated that the probability of such hiring results occurring by chance is a staggering one in a billion, suggesting that the discrepancies in hiring may not be merely coincidental. This statistic underscores the severity of the allegations and the potential implications for Palantir's reputation and operations as a federal contractor.

Peter Thiel, a well-known figure in the tech industry and a notable supporter of former President Donald Trump, is at the center of the controversy. Thiel, a first-generation immigrant, has faced criticism for backing a political candidate who has been vocally opposed to immigration policies. This juxtaposition has drawn scrutiny, especially considering Thiel's own background and the values he espouses.

Thiel's prominence extends beyond his role at Palantir. He is recognized as a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, which has significantly shaped the landscape of technology and social media. Additionally, he gained notoriety for his involvement in financing Hulk Hogan's successful lawsuit against Gawker Media, which further elevated his profile in both business and media circles.

In a historic moment, Thiel made headlines as the first openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention. During his speech, he advocated for individual identity and criticized government incompetence, garnering applause from attendees. However, the Republican Party simultaneously adopted an anti-LGBT platform during the same convention, creating a stark contrast between Thiel's personal beliefs and the party's policies.

The Department of Labor's lawsuit against Palantir serves as a reminder of the obligations that federal contractors have to maintain non-discriminatory hiring practices. The agency has emphasized the importance of ensuring that all candidates are treated fairly, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This lawsuit not only seeks to address the alleged discrimination but also aims to reinforce the principle that federal contractors must uphold the highest standards of equity in their employment practices.

In response to the allegations, a spokesperson for Palantir Technologies stated that the company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims of bias. The spokesperson expressed confidence in Palantir's hiring practices and reiterated the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion within its workforce.

As the lawsuit unfolds, it remains to be seen how these allegations will impact Palantir's operations, its standing as a federal contractor, and Thiel's reputation as a prominent figure in both the tech industry and political landscape. The outcome could have far-reaching implications, not only for Palantir but also for the broader conversation surrounding employment discrimination and the responsibilities of federal contractors in the United States.

In an era where diversity and inclusion are increasingly prioritized in the workplace, the outcome of this case may serve as a critical test for Palantir and its leadership. As the company prepares to defend itself in court, stakeholders and observers alike will be watching closely to see how this high-profile case develops and what it means for the future of hiring practices in the tech industry.",-18.0,-8.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,688.0,-0.2962962962962963,-0.011627906976744186

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general.

The Chelsea bombing that occurred last Saturday has prompted a thorough investigation by local law enforcement, as officials work to uncover the details behind the attack that left 29 individuals injured. The explosion, which took place in a bustling area of Manhattan, has raised significant concerns over public safety and potential further threats.

In the aftermath of the explosion, authorities discovered a second pressure-cooker bomb in a Dumpster located just four blocks away from the initial blast site. This alarming find has intensified the urgency of the investigation, as police seek to determine whether the two incidents are connected and what implications they may hold for the community.

As investigators delve deeper into the circumstances surrounding the bombing, three significant leads have emerged that may provide crucial insights into the motives and identity of the perpetrator. 

The first lead involves a hand-written letter that was found alongside the second bomb. This letter, which is partially written in Arabic, has raised questions about the potential motivations behind the attack. Authorities are analyzing the contents of the letter for any clues that could help identify the bomber or shed light on their intentions.

The second lead comes from an alarming 911 call made by an unidentified male caller. During the call, the individual warned of further explosions, ominously stating, “There will be more.” This warning has heightened fears among residents and prompted police to increase security measures in the area.

The third lead in the investigation is a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber,’ which claims to serve as the bomber's manifesto. The post discusses various societal issues, expressing frustration over the treatment of the LGBTQ+ community and other forms of inequality. The author of the Tumblr post characterizes the bombings as ""test"" actions and suggests a willingness to continue their violent campaign, further instilling fear in the community.

While the Tumblr post has garnered significant attention, skepticism surrounds its authenticity. Experts and law enforcement officials have raised concerns about individuals claiming responsibility for the bombing without any actual involvement. This skepticism underscores the complexity of the investigation, as authorities must determine the credibility of online claims amid the chaos of the aftermath.

As the investigation progresses, police are working diligently to piece together the evidence and assess the potential threats to public safety. The community remains on edge, with many residents expressing their shock and concern over the violence that has erupted in their neighborhood.

In response to the bombing, local officials have urged residents to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. The city has also increased its police presence in Chelsea and surrounding areas to reassure the public and deter any potential further attacks.

Authorities are appealing to anyone with information related to the bombing or the subsequent leads to come forward. The investigation is ongoing, and police are committed to bringing those responsible to justice.

As the community grapples with the aftermath of this violent incident, the focus remains on ensuring safety and preventing any future attacks. The Chelsea bombing serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that urban areas face and the importance of community cooperation in addressing threats to public safety.",-25.0,-21.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,593.0,-0.875,-0.03541315345699832
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

As Donald Trump, now 70 years old, ramps up his campaign for the presidency, questions about his mental fitness have emerged, particularly as he prepares for a pivotal debate against Hillary Clinton. With little rest amid a flurry of last-minute rallies, the former president's ability to articulate coherent thoughts has come under scrutiny.

In a recent tweet, Trump displayed signs of stress and incoherence, raising eyebrows among political analysts and supporters alike. The tweet, which touched on a variety of unrelated topics, included alarming mentions of five individuals killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant, rising drug overdose deaths in Ohio, and civil unrest in North Carolina. This eclectic mix of issues, presented without clear connections, has led to concerns that Trump's mind may be wandering, potentially signaling a lack of focus as he approaches a critical moment in his campaign.

The disjointed nature of the tweet suggests that Trump may be struggling to maintain the mental sharpness required for a high-stakes debate. As he juggles multiple campaign events and the pressures of the election cycle, the implications of his mental acuity could represent a turning point for his campaign. Voters and political commentators are closely monitoring his performance, particularly in the face of his opponent's strategic positioning.

The current political landscape is fraught with challenges, and Trump's ability to effectively communicate his vision and respond to pressing issues is paramount. The signs of stress exhibited in his recent social media activity may not only reflect his personal state but could also resonate with voters who seek a candidate capable of handling the demands of the presidency.

As the debate approaches, the focus will undoubtedly remain on Trump's mental fitness. The combination of his age, the intensity of the campaign, and the recent indicators of incoherence may serve as crucial factors in shaping public perception. With the election looming, the stakes are higher than ever, and how Trump navigates this period could significantly influence the outcome of his presidential bid. The coming days will reveal whether he can regain his footing or if these signs of distress will mark a decline in his campaign's momentum.",-22.0,-4.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,412.0,-0.2857142857142857,-0.009708737864077669

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Delaware, Ohio – In a disappointing turn of events for Hillary Clinton's campaign, a door-knocking event scheduled for 1 pm on a recent afternoon drew an unexpectedly low turnout, with only one attendee present. The event, which was anticipated to attract numerous volunteers eager to support Clinton, ultimately showcased a stark contrast between the former Secretary of State's campaign efforts and the robust support often seen at rallies for her opponent, Donald Trump.

The solitary attendee at the event was identified as a Donald Trump supporter, a detail that quickly became problematic for Clinton's campaign staff. Upon realizing the individual’s political affiliation, staff members asked the supporter to leave, further emphasizing the lack of engagement from the local community. What was meant to be a gathering of enthusiastic volunteers turned into a stark reminder of the challenges facing Clinton's campaign.

Despite the Clinton campaign office being well-prepared for the event, the absence of public turnout raises significant concerns about her ground game as the election approaches. The anticipated enthusiasm and volunteer support that typically characterize campaign events were noticeably absent, leaving only campaign staff members to navigate the situation. This lack of engagement could signal deeper issues within the campaign, particularly as comparisons to Trump's rallies become more pronounced.

As Trump continues to draw large crowds at his events, the disparity in attendance has sparked discussions among political analysts regarding the enthusiasm gap between the two candidates. Observers note that while Trump’s rallies are often filled to capacity, Clinton’s efforts seem to be struggling to capture similar interest. This growing divide could have implications for voter mobilization and support as the election nears.

The situation has also prompted speculation about Clinton's overall chances in the upcoming election. Concerns are mounting regarding her health and the adequacy of her campaign funding, both of which could impact her ability to connect with voters effectively. As these discussions unfold, the lack of turnout at the Delaware event serves as a tangible indicator of the challenges that lie ahead for Clinton and her team.

In a political landscape where enthusiasm can significantly influence election outcomes, the Clinton campaign may need to reassess its strategies to engage potential voters. The stark contrast in attendance between her events and those of Trump highlights the necessity for a renewed focus on grassroots mobilization and community outreach.

As the election approaches, the Democratic Party is faced with critical questions about Clinton's ability to galvanize support and compete effectively against a candidate who has demonstrated substantial appeal among his base. The implications of this enthusiasm gap could reverberate throughout the campaign, underscoring the importance of addressing the concerns that have emerged from events like the one in Delaware.

In conclusion, the door-knocking event in Delaware, Ohio, serves as a cautionary tale for the Clinton campaign. With only one attendee, the event not only reflected a lack of public interest but also raised broader questions about the campaign's viability in the face of a formidable opponent. As Clinton moves forward, the need for strategic adjustments and a renewed focus on voter engagement will be paramount in overcoming the challenges that lie ahead.",-7.0,30.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,597.0,1.4285714285714286,0.05025125628140704

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

New York City was rocked by a bombing that has ignited a wave of political responses and media scrutiny. Former President Donald Trump was quick to react, labeling the incident as a ""bombing"" during an interview. His choice of words, however, has drawn criticism from CNN, which questioned the appropriateness of his terminology, despite the fact that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had used the same description in her own commentary on the event.

The media outlet's criticism of Trump’s language has raised eyebrows, particularly because CNN later edited out Clinton's reference to the bombing in their coverage. This move has led to accusations of bias and inconsistency in how the network reports on political figures, with Trump seizing the opportunity to condemn CNN during his appearance on Fox and Friends. He described the network as ""disgusting and disgraceful,"" further asserting that they are dishonest and referring to them as the ""Clinton news network.""

In his interview, Trump did not hold back in his criticism of current leadership, particularly targeting what he labeled ""stupid"" leaders for their perceived softness on terrorism. He emphasized the urgent need for a tougher approach to national security, arguing that past policies have failed to adequately protect the country from threats. Trump's comments come amid a broader dialogue about how to handle terrorism and the influx of refugees into the United States.

The former president expressed particular concern over President Obama's plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017, a plan he claims Clinton supported and sought to expand. Trump has consistently voiced his belief that the current vetting process for incoming refugees is insufficient, stating that it poses a risk to national security. His rhetoric has resonated with a segment of the population that shares his apprehensions about refugee resettlement and the potential for terrorism.

As the political discourse continues to evolve in the wake of the bombing, Trump's remarks have reignited debates surrounding immigration policy and national security. His call for a more stringent vetting process reflects a growing sentiment among some voters who feel that the current administration has not done enough to address these concerns.

The incident in New York City has not only heightened fears about terrorism but has also become a flashpoint for political maneuvering. With the 2024 election cycle approaching, the responses from both Trump and Clinton are likely to be scrutinized as they seek to position themselves in a highly polarized political landscape.

As the nation grapples with the implications of the bombing, the reactions from political leaders and media outlets will continue to shape the narrative surrounding terrorism, immigration, and national security. The fallout from this incident serves as a reminder of the complexities involved in addressing these pressing issues, as well as the role that media coverage plays in influencing public perception.

In the coming days, it will be essential to monitor how these discussions unfold and whether they lead to any significant changes in policy or public sentiment. The bombing has undoubtedly reignited discussions about safety, security, and the responsibilities of leaders in protecting their citizens, making it a pivotal moment in the ongoing dialogue about terrorism and immigration in America.",-45.0,-17.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,601.0,-0.85,-0.028286189683860232

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

In an unexpected legal turn, Ahmad Rahami, a convicted terrorist and murderer, has filed a lawsuit against the police department in Elizabeth, New Jersey, claiming his family faced discrimination due to their cultural background while operating a local chicken restaurant since 2002. The lawsuit, lodged in federal court in Newark, has raised eyebrows given Rahami's criminal history.

The lawsuit alleges that Rahami's family, originally from Afghanistan, has been the target of local officials who sought to shut down their restaurant through a barrage of unfounded tickets and court summons. Ahmad, 28, along with his father, Mohammad Rahami Sr., 53, and brother Mohammad, are all named in the suit, which outlines a series of grievances against the Elizabeth police department.

Central to the family's claims is the assertion that they have experienced racial abuse, with reported incidents including derogatory comments such as ""Muslims don’t belong here."" The Rahami family contends that these experiences of discrimination have been compounded by the police's alleged harassment and retaliation, specifically targeting them for remaining open past the 10 PM curfew, which they assert they were legally permitted to do.

According to the lawsuit, the police cited concerns about crime in the area surrounding the restaurant as justification for their actions. However, the Rahami family argues that these concerns were unfounded and that they were unfairly singled out due to their cultural background. The family believes that the police's attempts to force their business to close early were not only discriminatory but also aimed at undermining their livelihood.

This legal battle comes five years after Ahmad Rahami was arrested for planting bombs in New York and New Jersey, an act that raised serious questions about his motivations and actions. The juxtaposition of his current lawsuit with his past criminal behavior has led to skepticism regarding the authenticity of his claims. Critics argue that the lawsuit could be an attempt to shift the focus away from his terrorist activities and paint his family as victims of systemic discrimination.

As the case unfolds, it remains to be seen how the courts will respond to the allegations made by the Rahami family. The lawsuit highlights ongoing discussions about discrimination, cultural bias, and the treatment of minority-owned businesses in America, especially in the context of law enforcement interactions.

Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Recent allegations have emerged suggesting pay-to-play corruption involving Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the integrity of the foundation's operations. Critics assert that the foundation has primarily functioned as a financial vehicle for the Clinton family and their associates rather than a genuine charitable organization.

In response to these allegations, the Clinton campaign has highlighted the foundation's charitable work, emphasizing its commitment to various causes. However, scrutiny of the foundation's financial records presents a different narrative. According to IRS filings, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation's budget in 2014 was allocated to charitable grants, a figure that has raised eyebrows among watchdog groups and critics alike.

The foundation's financial disclosures reveal that in 2014, it spent approximately $91.3 million, but less than $5.2 million of that amount was directed toward charity. A significant portion of the foundation's budget—$34.8 million—was consumed by salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, while $50.4 million was categorized as ""other expenses."" This allocation of funds has led to further allegations that the foundation's operations were more about generating income for the Clintons than about philanthropic endeavors.

Moreover, the foundation's charitable spending saw a dramatic decline of 40% in 2014 compared to the previous year, despite an increase in overall revenue. This drop in charitable contributions, coupled with a $5 million rise in salaries and employee benefits, has fueled concerns about the foundation's priorities and financial management.

The Clinton Foundation's operations and expenditures have sparked intense debate about the motivations behind its establishment and the effectiveness of its charitable initiatives. While supporters argue that the foundation has made significant contributions to various global causes, critics contend that the financial practices suggest a focus on personal gain rather than altruism.

As the allegations of pay-to-play corruption continue to unfold, the scrutiny surrounding the Clinton Foundation raises critical questions about transparency and accountability in charitable organizations. The foundation's financial practices and the allocation of its resources remain a contentious topic, with implications that could impact the legacy of Hillary Clinton and her philanthropic endeavors. The ongoing discourse emphasizes the importance of examining the intersection of politics and philanthropy, particularly in the context of high-profile figures like the Clintons.",25.0,7.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,427.0,0.4666666666666667,0.01639344262295082

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In a speech delivered in New York, former President Barack Obama has drawn sharp criticism from various quarters for his apparent insensitivity to recent violent incidents across the nation. The speech, which took place against the backdrop of bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing in St. Cloud, Minnesota, has left many Americans shocked and dismayed.

Rather than addressing the tragic events that have rattled the communities affected, Obama chose to focus his remarks on a high-dollar fundraising event. His decision to prioritize political fundraising over acknowledging the suffering caused by the recent attacks has led to accusations of tone-deafness. Critics argue that in times of crisis, a leader should offer solace and support, yet Obama’s speech seemed to ignore the gravity of the situation.

During his address, Obama directed his ire towards media figures, notably targeting Rush Limbaugh and Fox News. He expressed his belief that sexism in the media is detrimental to Hillary Clinton's campaign, a point he emphasized throughout his speech. The former president also took the opportunity to criticize Donald Trump, further shifting the focus away from the pressing national concerns that had recently arisen.

The decision not to mention the bombings or the stabbing has been met with widespread outrage. Many observers contend that Obama could have at least acknowledged the attacks and offered thoughts and prayers for the victims and their families. This omission has led some to describe the speech as insensitive, particularly given the timing and the emotional weight of the recent tragedies.

The backlash from critics has been swift. Some have labeled the speech as a missed opportunity for Obama to demonstrate leadership and empathy during a time of national distress. The expectation was that a former president would use such a platform to unite and console a grieving nation, rather than diverting attention to political fundraising and personal grievances against media personalities.

In the wake of the speech, social media platforms have been flooded with reactions, many of which express disappointment and frustration. Observers have pointed out that while political discourse is important, it should not come at the expense of acknowledging the pain and suffering experienced by citizens in the aftermath of violent attacks.

As the nation grapples with the fallout from the recent incidents, the focus remains on the need for solidarity and support for those affected. Critics of Obama’s speech argue that it is vital for leaders to recognize and respond to the realities facing their constituents, especially in moments of crisis. The former president’s decision to sidestep these issues has raised questions about his priorities and the message he wishes to convey during such tumultuous times.

In conclusion, Obama’s New York speech has sparked significant controversy, as many Americans feel that he failed to address the serious issues at hand. As the nation continues to heal from recent tragedies, the expectation remains that leaders will prioritize empathy and understanding over political agendas. The call for unity and recognition of shared grief resonates strongly, and the hope is that future communications will reflect the sensitivity that such situations demand.",-25.0,-54.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,586.0,-2.347826086956522,-0.09215017064846416
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

The American public's awareness of potential corruption at the Clinton Foundation has escalated, particularly during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. A recent report has surfaced, suggesting that the foundation may be in deeper trouble than previously understood, raising significant alarms about its operations.

According to The Daily Caller, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a prominent initiative of the Clinton Foundation, is under fire for allegedly distributing ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa. This troubling revelation has prompted further investigation, as a draft congressional report indicates that the distribution of these diluted medications could have ""likely increased"" risks of morbidity and mortality among patients who relied on them for treatment.

CHAI, recognized as one of the foundation’s most significant and well-known initiatives, now faces renewed scrutiny, particularly as Hillary Clinton embarks on her presidential campaign. The implications of this report could pose substantial challenges for her candidacy, as the integrity of the foundation comes into question.

Additionally, the congressional study highlights connections between former President Bill Clinton and controversial Indian-Americans who are currently linked to ongoing FDA and SEC investigations. This aspect of the report has raised further concerns regarding the foundation's support of Ranbaxy, an Indian pharmaceutical company notorious for its history of poor quality control and fraudulent reporting practices to the FDA.

While the report has sparked outrage and calls for accountability, uncertainty remains regarding the exact number of AIDS patients who may have received the compromised drugs. The potential ramifications of this situation are profound, leading some to call for the immediate shutdown of the Clinton Foundation to prevent any further harm.

As public awareness grows and investigations continue, the future of the Clinton Foundation hangs in the balance, with implications that could resonate well beyond the political arena.",-14.0,-12.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,345.0,-1.0909090909090908,-0.034782608695652174
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all. Because doesn’t government always know best?",http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,Mockarena Cotr,http://www.chicksontheright.com,{'$date': 1474332562000},,"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2fb62ae885c1cdb2a0c69249a9c25a?s=120&d=mm&r=g,http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN#!,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cotrolog-smalll.png,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CotR_banner1-copy-2.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8W3QtpyKy7xuZ.gif,http://rightchicks.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/book-thumb.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49-812x478.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kardashian-jenner-424x250.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d1x2X8_nNBHjc.gif",https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/,"{""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Chicks On The Right"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 812, ""identifier"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""height"": 550}, ""url"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""image"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""card"": ""summary"", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right""}, ""robots"": ""noodp"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/"", ""section"": ""Constitution"", ""tag"": ""felony"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-19T20:49:22-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}","- Arizona state legislature criticized for poorly worded laws affecting parenting activities.

The Arizona state legislature is under fire for enacting poorly worded laws that are having unintended consequences on parenting activities. One particular law has drawn significant criticism for its sweeping language, which criminalizes any contact between an adult and a child's genitals. This has raised serious concerns, as it effectively makes parents felons for performing routine caregiving tasks such as diaper changes and baths.

While the law was designed with the noble intention of protecting children from molesters, it has proven to be ineffective due to its vague and overreaching provisions. Critics argue that the legislation fails to strike a balance between safeguarding children and allowing parents to fulfill their essential caregiving roles without fear of legal repercussions.

In a controversial ruling, the Arizona Supreme Court has stated that defendants accused under this law must prove a lack of sexual intent. This ruling challenges the fundamental presumption of innocence that is a cornerstone of the American legal system. Legal experts have expressed alarm over this shift, suggesting that it places an undue burden on defendants who are now required to navigate a complicated legal landscape while attempting to defend themselves against potentially life-altering accusations.

The court's approach has also raised eyebrows as it implies a reliance on prosecutors to apply common sense in these cases. Instead of addressing the flaws in the legislation, the court has opted to maintain the status quo, leaving many parents and caregivers vulnerable to prosecution under a law that many believe is fundamentally flawed.

Legal expert John Pfaff has highlighted the implications of this ruling, particularly concerning the issue of plea bargaining. In many cases, defendants may feel pressured to admit guilt to lesser charges simply to avoid the risk of facing harsher penalties. This dynamic can lead to a troubling scenario where parents are coerced into accepting plea deals, potentially undermining their constitutional rights in the process.

The ramifications of this decision are significant, as it has effectively criminalized a wide swath of parents and caregivers who are simply trying to provide for their children. The lack of clear guidelines and protections raises serious questions about the reliability of the government in ensuring justice, especially for those who may find themselves entangled in a legal system that seems to prioritize punitive measures over common-sense parenting.

As it stands, due process appears to be suspended for many parents unless there is intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court. The chilling effect of this law is palpable, with many caregivers now wary of engaging in basic activities that are essential to child-rearing. 

The ongoing debate surrounding Arizona's child molestation laws highlights a critical need for legislative reform that better protects children while also respecting the rights of parents. As the conversation continues, the focus remains on how to create laws that are both effective in safeguarding against abuse and fair to those who are simply fulfilling their responsibilities as caregivers. The situation serves as a stark reminder of the complexities involved in creating legislation that balances the protection of vulnerable populations with the preservation of individual rights.",-12.0,-34.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,560.0,-1.7,-0.060714285714285714

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As speculation mounts regarding the potential roles of key figures in a Hillary Clinton administration, discussions have turned to Michelle Obama and the possibility of her continued influence in the White House. While some view this as a natural progression given her previous position as First Lady, others express skepticism about the implications of such a development.

Critics of ongoing coverage of the Obamas have voiced their disdain, arguing that the media’s fixation on the former First Family detracts from pressing national issues. This sentiment is particularly strong among those who reflect negatively on Michelle Obama's legacy. Her initiatives, including the widely debated school lunch program, have drawn scrutiny, with detractors questioning their effectiveness and the rationale behind them. Furthermore, Michelle Obama’s famous declaration about her pride in the country has been revisited with a critical lens, prompting discussions about the broader implications of her sentiments during her time in the White House.

Amid these discussions, questions have arisen regarding Michelle Obama's qualifications for any potential new role in a Clinton administration. Critics argue that her previous experiences may not sufficiently prepare her for a position that could influence policy, especially in areas as vital as education and child welfare. This skepticism is compounded by concerns about the progressive influence on education and the implications of increased government control over parenting.

Hillary Clinton has long been an advocate for government involvement in child-rearing, a stance that aligns with her vision for a more engaged governmental role in the lives of American families. This philosophy raises eyebrows among those who feel uneasy about the state stepping in as a parental figure. The idea that government could play a significant role in shaping the upbringing of children is a contentious topic, with many fearing that it could undermine parental authority and individual family dynamics.

Despite the criticism, Michelle Obama remains committed to her healthy living campaign for children, which emphasizes long-term strategies for fostering wellness among the youth. Her dedication to this cause has garnered support from various sectors, but it also raises questions about the extent to which such initiatives should be driven by governmental policies rather than personal or community-based efforts.

The intersection of these issues paints a complex picture of the potential for Michelle Obama to return to the political spotlight. While her advocacy for health and wellness among children resonates with many, the broader implications of her involvement in a Clinton administration could evoke significant debate. As discussions unfold, it remains to be seen how the public will respond to the prospect of Michelle Obama taking on a more prominent role in shaping policy, particularly in areas that directly impact children and families.

In this climate of speculation, it is essential to consider the broader implications of government involvement in child-rearing and education. As the nation grapples with these questions, the role of influential figures like Michelle Obama will undoubtedly be a focal point of discussion. Whether her legacy will be viewed through a lens of positive change or criticism will likely depend on the outcomes of future policies and the ongoing dialogue about the role of government in family life. 

In conclusion, the potential for Michelle Obama to play a role in a Hillary Clinton administration raises important questions about qualifications, legacy, and the influence of government in personal lives. As these conversations continue, the public's comfort level with government as a parental figure will be pivotal in shaping the future of American policy and family dynamics.",6.0,8.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,650.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012307692307692308

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A new controversy has emerged surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), raising serious allegations of corruption linked to the distribution of ineffective HIV/AIDS medications in Africa. The initiative, which has long been touted for its efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic, is now facing scrutiny over claims that it distributed ""watered-down"" drugs, which reportedly increased the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients reliant on these treatments.

Central to this scandal is Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, a company that has a troubled history in the pharmaceutical industry. Ranbaxy was found guilty in 2013 of multiple counts of fraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into the market, leading to a staggering $500 million fine. The congressional report titled ""The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,"" initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, sheds light on the troubling relationship between CHAI and Ranbaxy, suggesting that the partnership may have contributed to the distribution of substandard drugs.

Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower from Ranbaxy, played a pivotal role in bringing attention to the company's malpractices, having helped launch a significant lawsuit against the firm. His revelations have raised pressing questions about the number of lives potentially lost and the false promises made to patients due to the distribution of these ineffective medications. The implications of the report are stark, as it calls into question the integrity of health initiatives that are supposed to protect vulnerable populations.

Further complicating the narrative are concerns regarding inappropriate ties between former President Bill Clinton and various Indian-American individuals who have been investigated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Critics argue that these connections could have influenced the decisions made by CHAI and the Clinton Foundation, particularly in their dealings with Ranbaxy.

The Clinton Foundation has faced mounting criticism for its decision to promote Ranbaxy, despite the company's well-documented quality control issues. This raises ethical concerns about the motivations behind the foundation's partnerships and whether financial gain has taken precedence over the health and wellbeing of individuals, especially in regions heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS.

In a striking revelation, ProPublica reported that in 2007, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy, which resulted in the distribution of more than 1.8 million packages of drugs. While these efforts were intended to provide essential medications to those in need, the quality of the drugs being distributed has come under fire, leading to fears that patients may have been receiving ineffective treatments.

Compounding the issue, Ranbaxy's generic drugs are currently banned in the United States due to safety concerns, yet they continue to be sold globally. This raises alarming questions about the oversight and regulation of pharmaceutical products in international markets, particularly in developing countries where healthcare resources are already limited. Despite these concerns, the Clinton Foundation has not severed its ties with Ranbaxy, further fueling allegations of rampant corruption within the organization.

As the investigation unfolds, the implications of these findings could be far-reaching, prompting calls for accountability from the Clinton Foundation and CHAI. Critics argue that the revelations indicate a troubling pattern of prioritizing financial interests over the health and safety of individuals, particularly those in Africa who are most vulnerable to the impacts of HIV/AIDS.

The scandal has reignited debates about the ethics of philanthropic organizations and their partnerships with private companies in the pharmaceutical sector. As public trust in such initiatives wanes, there is an urgent need for transparency and accountability to ensure that health interventions genuinely serve the populations they aim to help.

In light of these serious allegations, the future of CHAI and its partnerships remains uncertain. Stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers, are closely monitoring the developments, hoping for a resolution that prioritizes the health and safety of individuals over financial gain.

As more details emerge from the congressional report and ongoing investigations, the spotlight will remain on the Clinton Foundation and its role in the distribution of HIV/AIDS medications. The potential fallout from this scandal could have lasting implications for public health initiatives and the credibility of organizations that seek to make a difference in global health.

In conclusion, the allegations surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its relationship with Ranbaxy highlight a critical need for reform in how health initiatives operate and the partnerships they forge. As the world grapples with the ongoing challenges of HIV/AIDS, it is imperative that organizations prioritize the wellbeing of patients above all else, ensuring that the promises made to vulnerable populations are not only met but upheld with integrity and accountability.",-63.0,-36.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,863.0,-1.3333333333333333,-0.04171494785631518

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant ruling, a federal judge has mandated that the State Department release documents pertaining to security training completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides within a strict timeframe of five days. The order comes as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF), which is seeking to confirm whether Clinton, along with key aides Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, and Jacob Sullivan, completed the mandatory security briefings necessary for handling classified materials.

Judge Richard Leon, presiding over the case, firmly rejected the State Department's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, emphasizing the importance of transparency in the handling of government records. The ruling reflects a growing frustration with the State Department's delays in producing the requested information, which has been a point of contention in the ongoing discourse surrounding Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.

TheDCNF's pursuit of these records is rooted in concerns over national security protocols and the adherence of high-ranking officials to established guidelines for managing classified information. As part of the lawsuit, the organization has specifically requested documentation that would confirm the completion of security training by Clinton and her aides, which is a critical aspect of their responsibilities in handling sensitive information.

In a July response, State Department officials acknowledged that their failure to produce the requested documents suggested that the required security training courses had not been completed by Clinton or her aides. This admission has raised further questions about the extent of compliance with security protocols during Clinton's time in office, particularly in light of the scrutiny surrounding her use of a private email server for official communications.

Judge Leon's order requires the State Department to release one-third of the approximately 400 documents by September 26, with the remainder to be disclosed by October 10. The timeline set forth by the judge underscores the urgency of the matter and reflects a judicial commitment to ensuring that the FOIA process is upheld without unnecessary obstruction.

Bradley Moss, the attorney representing TheDCNF, commented on the judge's ruling, stating that it indicates a clear frustration with the State Department's handling of the FOIA process. Moss's remarks highlight the broader implications of the case, as it raises questions about the accountability of government agencies in responding to public records requests and the transparency of operations within the federal government.

The backdrop of this legal battle is marked by ongoing debates about the accountability of public officials and the protocols in place to safeguard classified information. As the public continues to demand clarity on these issues, the judge's ruling serves as a reminder of the importance of adherence to established procedures and the need for transparency in government operations.

As the State Department prepares to comply with the court's order, the release of these documents is anticipated to shed light on the security training practices followed by Clinton and her aides. The outcome of this case may have lasting implications for how government agencies handle FOIA requests and the level of scrutiny applied to the actions of high-ranking officials.

In conclusion, the federal judge's order to release documents regarding the security training of Hillary Clinton and her top aides marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing discourse surrounding government transparency and accountability. The forthcoming release of these records may provide critical insights into the compliance of Clinton and her team with mandatory security protocols, further informing the public's understanding of the responsibilities and actions of those in positions of power. As the situation develops, all eyes will be on the State Department's response and the implications of the released documents for the broader conversation about national security and government oversight.",-5.0,2.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,693.0,0.10526315789473684,0.002886002886002886
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton approaches, concerns are mounting over the lack of a structured fact-checking process during the event. NBC News has indicated that moderator Lester Holt will not engage in fact-checking candidates, a decision that could significantly impact the integrity of the debate.

The absence of immediate fact-checking allows Trump to make unverified statements without accountability, relying solely on Clinton to challenge him. This dynamic raises questions about the fairness of the debate, as Trump has been documented to make false claims at an alarming rate of approximately every three-and-a-half minutes. The stakes are high, and the implications of unchecked statements could influence public perception in a critical election cycle.

Major cable and broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, have also announced that they will refrain from providing on-screen fact checks during the debate. While on-screen fact-checking could serve to expose inaccuracies in real-time without interrupting the debate's flow, networks appear to prioritize ratings over accountability. This decision reflects a broader trend in journalism where entertainment often takes precedence over the rigorous standards of factual reporting.

The Clinton campaign has voiced its concerns regarding the moderator's role in challenging falsehoods. Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri emphasized that unchallenged lies give Trump an unfair advantage, potentially skewing the debate's outcome. With the expectation that Clinton will perform well, the lack of a supportive fact-checking framework may hinder public perception of her success, allowing Trump’s misleading statements to linger unaddressed.

Critics of the current media landscape argue that the state of journalism is failing, or perhaps already dead, as the commitment to accountability wanes in favor of viewer engagement. This sentiment resonates particularly in the context of the upcoming debate, where the absence of fact-checking could lead to a distorted representation of the candidates' positions and statements.

As the nation gears up for the debate, the implications of this lack of accountability are profound. Voters may find themselves navigating a landscape of misinformation without the tools to discern fact from fiction. The debate is not just a platform for candidates to present their visions for America; it is also a critical moment for the media to uphold its responsibility in ensuring a fair and informed electoral process.

In the end, the decision not to fact-check could have lasting repercussions, shaping voter perceptions and potentially influencing the outcome of the election. As the debate unfolds, all eyes will be on the candidates, but the absence of journalistic rigor raises urgent questions about the future of political discourse in America.",-6.0,-10.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,482.0,-0.5555555555555556,-0.02074688796680498
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

Dolly Kyle, a long-time friend of former President Bill Clinton, has voiced significant concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency. In a recent interview, Kyle expressed that she believes Clinton is driven by anger and rage, which she argues could lead to a potential physical breakdown.

Kyle's assertions extend beyond mere emotional observations; she claims that Clinton is suffering from cognitive impairment, emotional instability, memory loss, and difficulties in executing tasks. These allegations raise questions about Clinton's mental acuity and overall fitness for the demanding role of president. 

Furthermore, Kyle has pointed to what she describes as Clinton's paranoia and controlling nature, traits she deems problematic for anyone seeking the highest office in the land. According to Kyle, these characteristics could hinder effective leadership and decision-making, which are crucial for a presidential candidate.

In an effort to shed light on these issues, Kyle authored a book titled ""Hillary the Other Woman,"" which aims to reveal what she perceives as the truth about Clinton, particularly concerning her health. Through her writing, Kyle seeks to provide insight into the personal and psychological challenges she believes Clinton faces, suggesting that these factors could impact her ability to lead.

Kyle does not shy away from making bold accusations, alleging that Clinton is power-hungry and willing to jeopardize her own health and the integrity of the Democratic Party to achieve her political ambitions. These claims contribute to the already negative perceptions surrounding Clinton, particularly regarding her health, character, and leadership abilities.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, these revelations from Kyle may resonate with voters who are increasingly concerned about the health and stability of their potential leaders. The implications of such claims could have far-reaching effects on Clinton's candidacy and the Democratic Party as a whole.

With the 2024 presidential election on the horizon, the scrutiny surrounding Hillary Clinton is likely to intensify. As discussions about her fitness for office gain traction, Kyle’s revelations add another layer to the ongoing debate about Clinton’s qualifications and readiness to serve as president. Whether these concerns will significantly impact public perception remains to be seen, but they certainly highlight the complexities of political candidacy in an era where health and character are under constant examination.",-13.0,0.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,437.0,0.0,0.0

YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT THEY MUST INTEGRATE AND LEARN TO LIVE IN CANADA.

FOR THIS REASON, THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE. FINALLY, THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN CANADA, WITH ITS JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ROOTS, CHRISTMAS TREES, CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS, RELIGION MUST REMAIN IN THE PRIVATE SPHERE. THE MUNICIPALITY OF DURVAL HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY CONCESSIONS TO ISLAM AND SHARIA LAW. FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

In an era marked by increasing diversity, the United States faces a critical juncture in its immigration policy. The need for a unified approach to immigration has never been more pressing, as the nation grapples with the complexities of maintaining its identity while welcoming newcomers. The concept of America as a ""melting pot"" is well ingrained in the national consciousness; however, it is essential to emphasize the importance of a cohesive national identity that respects and preserves the core values of American culture.

A growing concern among some citizens is the perception that certain immigrants are reluctant to embrace the customs and traditions of their new home. This sentiment echoes the views of a Quebec mayor, who recently made headlines by asserting that immigrants, particularly from Muslim backgrounds, must adapt to Canadian customs and traditions. His comments reflect a broader frustration with the notion that immigrant communities can maintain their cultural practices without regard for the host nation's values.

The mayor's remarks highlight a significant divide in how different nations approach multiculturalism. He argues that Canadians are not inherently racist or xenophobic; rather, they are open to diverse cultures, unlike some Muslim-majority countries. This assertion raises important questions about the expectations placed on immigrants and the responsibilities they bear in integrating into their new societies.

Central to this discussion is the preservation of Canadian culture, which the mayor claims is rooted in Judeo-Christian values. He emphasizes that religion should remain a private matter, indicating a desire for a secular public sphere where cultural cohesion can thrive. In this context, the municipality of Dorval has been cited as an example of where local governance has the authority to refuse concessions to Islam and Sharia law, reinforcing the idea that certain cultural practices may be at odds with the prevailing norms.

The mayor's position leads to a provocative conclusion: if immigrants do not agree with or respect Canadian culture, they should consider returning to their countries of origin. This sentiment resonates with many who feel frustrated by the notion that immigrants can dictate terms or change the lives of native citizens. It raises the question of what it means to be a part of a nation and the expectations that come with that identity.

In the United States, similar sentiments have emerged, particularly in states like Texas, where legislative actions have been taken to prevent the introduction of Sharia law into the legal system. This move is indicative of a broader trend among states that seek to safeguard their cultural and legal frameworks from external influences perceived as incompatible with American values.

The overarching message from these discussions is clear: there is a growing call for immigrants to either integrate into the adopted culture or reconsider their place within it. The idea that attempts to change the culture will ultimately fail is gaining traction, as many believe that a harmonious society relies on a shared understanding and respect for the foundational values of the nation.

As America continues to navigate the complexities of immigration, the emphasis on a unified approach becomes increasingly vital. The challenge lies not only in welcoming newcomers but also in fostering an environment where cultural exchange occurs within the framework of a shared national identity. For the United States to thrive as a true melting pot, it must find a balance between embracing diversity and ensuring that the core values of its culture remain intact.",12.0,30.0,577.0,0.4444444444444444,0.02079722703639515,632.0,1.3636363636363635,0.04746835443037975

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a recent incident during Black Lives Matter protests in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by demonstrators while in his vehicle. The scene unfolded amidst heightened emotions and tensions associated with the ongoing protests, which have drawn attention to issues of racial injustice and police violence.

Eyewitnesses reported that the man appeared to be in a precarious situation, with one witness expressing concern that he might be mugged. However, in a surprising turn of events, the protesters allowed the man to pass without incident. This moment of restraint from the demonstrators contrasted sharply with other reports emerging from similar protests across the country, where rioters have been known to stop vehicles and commit acts of theft.

As the man attempted to navigate through the crowd, he displayed a handgun from his window. The sight of the firearm prompted the protesters to disperse quickly, showcasing a different dynamic in this particular incident. While some may view the man's approach as controversial, it has sparked discussions about the ways individuals can handle potentially volatile situations during protests.

The incident has raised questions about the balance between self-defense and escalation during protests, particularly in a climate where tensions can quickly flare. Some observers have noted that the man’s actions, while alarming to some, may be seen as a viable response to a threatening environment, especially in light of the contrasting behaviors exhibited by some protesters in other instances.

As the nation grapples with the complexities of protests and the various responses they elicit, this incident serves as a reminder of the diverse experiences individuals face in such charged atmospheres. The North Carolina event underscores the need for dialogue about safety, personal rights, and the broader implications of demonstrations aimed at social justice.

In the wake of this incident, community leaders and activists are encouraged to continue discussions on how to foster peaceful protests while ensuring the safety of all participants. As the Black Lives Matter movement continues to evolve, understanding the nuances of interactions like these will be crucial in shaping future demonstrations and community relations.",-18.0,-20.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,395.0,-1.4285714285714286,-0.05063291139240506
Fake_8-Webpage,The Black Sphere with Kevin Jackson,"Chicago Environmentalist Scumbags

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago's environmental community is under fire for what some critics perceive as hypocrisy regarding their stance on various development projects within the city. Accusations have emerged that leftist groups are shifting their positions based on personal impact rather than consistent environmental principles.

A notable point of contention is the support given by environmentalists for the construction of the Obama Presidential Center while simultaneously opposing George Lucas's proposed museum project. Juanita Irizarry, a prominent figure from Friends of the Parks, publicly expressed her backing for the Obama center's construction, despite it necessitating the removal of trees and grass at Jackson Park.

In contrast, Lucas's museum was intended to be built on a parking lot, which raises questions about the environmental priorities of those opposing it. Critics argue that the different responses to these two high-profile developments highlight contradictions in the environmentalist movement and reflect the complexities of Chicago's political landscape.

This situation has sparked a broader debate about the principles guiding environmental advocacy in the city. As the construction of the Obama center progresses, the environmental community's actions are being scrutinized, leading to calls for a more consistent approach to development and conservation efforts.

The unfolding controversy serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by environmentalists in balancing development needs with ecological preservation, particularly in a city where political interests often intersect with environmental policy. As these discussions continue, the future of both the Obama Presidential Center and Lucas's museum remains uncertain, with environmentalists' credibility hanging in the balance.",3.0,0.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,288.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_80-Webpage,Obama: “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.”,"This is a true story. General Stanley McChrystal was the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan and he had frequent disagreements on the conduct of the war with his Commander-in-Chief.

At one point McChrystal was called into the Oval Office and he knew his Army career was about to be over.

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

In a significant turn of events, General Stanley McChrystal, the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, has resigned following a tense meeting with President Barack Obama. The relationship between McChrystal and Obama had been fraught with disagreements regarding the conduct of the war, leading to a climactic confrontation in the Oval Office.

During the meeting, President Obama confronted McChrystal, accusing him of lacking political support. McChrystal, however, stood firm in his conviction, asserting that his loyalty was to Obama as Commander-in-Chief rather than as a politician. This principled stance led him to submit his resignation, a move that was anticipated given the escalating tensions between the two leaders.

The exchange took a sharp turn when Obama expressed dissatisfaction with McChrystal’s perspective, making a derogatory comment about how the general might feel after his death. In a moment that underscores his character, McChrystal saluted and responded with dignity, indicating he would not ""cut in line"" at a funeral, a remark that reflected his commitment to military decorum and respect.

This incident paints McChrystal as an honorable man, dedicated to his duty and the principles of military service.

Imagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm.

These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has recently witnessed a surge of unrest, with local police union officials revealing that at least 70% of the rioters involved were from out of state. This alarming statistic raises questions about the motivations and origins of the individuals participating in the protests that have gripped the city, contrasting sharply with a more peaceful demonstration that took place in Tulsa.

Reports emerging from the scene suggest that many of these out-of-state individuals possessed identification from other states, leading to speculation that they may have been bused in specifically for the protests. This organized influx of non-local participants has led to an increasingly chaotic environment in Charlotte, with local law enforcement struggling to maintain order amid the turmoil.

The protests in Charlotte have drawn criticism for being co-opted by outside radicals who are allegedly using the local Black Lives Matter community as a facade for their activities. The police chief emphasized that the individuals causing unrest in the city were not representative of local protestors; instead, they were viewed as instigators with a different agenda. This distinction raises significant concerns about the integrity of the protests and the true motivations behind the actions of those involved.

In stark contrast, the situation in Tulsa has remained relatively calm. Experts suggest that this difference may be attributed to a lack of sympathy for the Black Lives Matter movement among local residents, coupled with the recent charging of a police officer involved in a controversial shooting. These factors appear to have contributed to a more subdued response in Tulsa, highlighting the complexities of public sentiment surrounding such movements across different regions.

The article posits that the intent behind the riots in Charlotte is not merely to advocate for social justice or police reform, but rather to incite chaos and provoke race riots in the streets. This perspective frames the actions of the rioters as part of a larger, more sinister agenda, suggesting that their interests lie more in creating disorder than in addressing the pressing issues at hand.

As tensions continue to rise in Charlotte, local officials are grappling with the implications of these protests and the role that external influences may play in shaping the narrative. The police chief's remarks underscore the need for a critical examination of who is participating in these demonstrations and why. The involvement of out-of-state rioters complicates the dialogue surrounding the protests, raising questions about the authenticity of the local movement and the potential for manipulation by radical elements.

In light of these developments, community leaders and residents are left to ponder the future of protests in Charlotte and what they mean for the broader conversation about race and justice in America. The ongoing unrest serves as a reminder of the challenges facing those who are genuinely invested in advocating for change, as they must navigate a landscape increasingly marred by violence and outside interference.

As the situation unfolds, the distinction between local advocates for justice and those seeking to incite chaos will be critical in determining the direction of future protests. The community's response to these challenges will ultimately shape the narrative surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement in Charlotte and beyond. In the meantime, the city remains on edge, as law enforcement works to restore order and address the underlying issues that have fueled this wave of unrest. 

The events in Charlotte serve as a poignant illustration of the complexities surrounding social movements today, highlighting the need for unity and clarity of purpose amidst the chaos. As the nation watches, the hope remains that constructive dialogue can emerge from the turmoil, paving the way for meaningful change.",-17.0,-17.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,664.0,-0.7727272727272727,-0.025602409638554216
Fake_82-Webpage,Hillary's DEAD!?!? Brand New Theory Has Serious PROOF,"Hillary Clinton’s health is the top issue in the Presidential campaign. Once considered a “conspiracy theory,” Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases.

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!

Hillary Clinton's health has emerged as a significant issue in the current Presidential campaign, with concerns gaining traction among the American public that were previously dismissed as mere ""conspiracy theories."" The discussion intensified following her collapse on September 11th, an incident that has led even supportive media outlets to scrutinize her health more closely.

Adding fuel to the fire, expert Clif Hite has proposed a controversial theory suggesting that Clinton may have died and been replaced by body doubles and CGI images. If substantiated, this theory would indicate a substantial political coverup that could shake the foundations of the campaign.

Further complicating the narrative, reports have surfaced alleging that Russian intelligence claims Clinton has never left her Chelsea apartment and is utilizing doubles. These assertions have raised eyebrows and sparked debate among political analysts and the public alike.

Additionally, allegations have emerged regarding a secret plane crash that purportedly injured Clinton, with some sources considering this information credible. As speculation mounts, the article invites readers to weigh in on the matter, asking whether they believe Clinton was injured or killed in a crash and subsequently replaced by CGI representations.

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC.

In a politically charged environment leading up to the presidential election, a new organization has surfaced with the explicit goal of opposing candidate Donald Trump. Common Defense PAC, funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, has recently been highlighted by Discover the Networks, which revealed a comprehensive list of 187 groups receiving financial backing from Soros that have been actively targeting Trump.

Common Defense PAC claims to represent the interests of veterans, yet scrutiny has arisen regarding its actual leadership and organizational structure. While the PAC lists a leadership team on its website, it notably lacks contact information for its members, raising questions about transparency and accountability within the organization.

The PAC has been active in disseminating anti-Trump content, utilizing various platforms to amplify its message. Among its strategies, Common Defense PAC has shared videos linked to MoveOn.org, a progressive advocacy group that has also been vocal in its opposition to Trump. The collaboration between these two organizations has led to the promotion of the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which aims to galvanize opposition among veteran communities and their supporters.

In a notable campaign effort, Common Defense PAC participated in a Thunderclap initiative titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump, which successfully reached over 4.5 million individuals. This campaign garnered support from various actors and pundits, further amplifying its reach and influence. The PAC's ability to mobilize such a large audience underscores the significance of social media in contemporary political activism.

Additionally, Common Defense PAC has actively participated in protests aimed at influencing established political figures. In a recent collaboration with MoveOn.org, the PAC organized a demonstration urging Senator John McCain to revoke his endorsement of Trump. This kind of grassroots activism reflects the PAC's strategy to leverage public sentiment against the Trump campaign, particularly among veterans and their allies.

Despite its claims of representing veterans, the legitimacy of Common Defense PAC's representation has been questioned. A review of the PAC's July quarterly filing report reveals that it has only one donor, Marjorie Roswell, who contributed $20,000. This raises concerns about the financial backing and support for the organization, as it appears to rely heavily on a single source of funding.

The leadership of Common Defense PAC is also drawing scrutiny. Director Perry O’Brien, a long-time left-wing activist and conscientious objector, has a history of involvement with anti-war movements, including Iraq Veterans Against the War. While O’Brien's experience in activism may lend credibility to his role, the PAC's representation of veterans is predominantly centered around him, which could undermine its claims of being a broad-based coalition representing diverse veteran perspectives.

The emergence of Common Defense PAC and its alignment with other Soros-funded groups suggests a concerted effort to undermine Trump's campaign as the election approaches. With a network of organizations that share a common goal of opposing Trump, the political landscape is becoming increasingly polarized. The tactics employed by Common Defense PAC, including social media campaigns and public protests, reflect a strategic approach to mobilize opposition against the candidate.

As the election nears, the influence of such organizations on the political discourse will likely continue to grow, raising important questions about the role of funding and activism in shaping public opinion. The intersection of veteran representation and political activism presents a complex narrative, as organizations like Common Defense PAC navigate their mission amidst the contentious backdrop of the upcoming presidential election.

In summary, Common Defense PAC's emergence as a Soros-funded entity dedicated to opposing Donald Trump highlights the intricate dynamics of political fundraising and activism. With its questionable representation of veterans and reliance on a single donor, the PAC’s effectiveness and legitimacy may come under further scrutiny as the campaign unfolds. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the impact of such organizations on voter sentiment and election outcomes remains to be seen.",8.0,19.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,721.0,0.7037037037037037,0.026352288488210817

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

In a recent report by CBS, it has come to light that the Obama administration allocated a staggering $770 million in taxpayer money for the renovation of mosques overseas. This funding initiative, originally aimed at fostering goodwill and building relationships with Islamic leaders, has sparked significant outrage among taxpayer advocates and critics alike.

The allocation of such a substantial sum during a time when many Americans are grappling with economic hardship raises serious questions about the priorities of the federal government. With one-third of the American workforce reportedly out of work, critics argue that the focus on renovating foreign mosques appears misplaced, especially as domestic economic struggles continue to affect millions of citizens.

Jared Thomas, a prominent taxpayer advocate, has been vocal in his condemnation of the spending, labeling it as irresponsible. He emphasized the nation's mounting debt, arguing that taxpayer dollars should not be funneled into foreign projects when many Americans are struggling to make ends meet. ""We are in a financial crisis, and yet the government is choosing to support Islamic countries and their institutions,"" Thomas stated. His comments reflect a growing sentiment among concerned citizens who feel that the government should prioritize domestic needs over international spending.

The funding has also raised alarms regarding potential support for terror-related groups. Critics argue that by financing the renovation of mosques, the U.S. may inadvertently be aiding organizations that could harbor extremist ideologies. This concern is particularly poignant in an era where national security remains a top priority for many Americans. The notion that taxpayer money could be used to support institutions that may not align with American values has left many feeling uneasy.

In defense of the funding, the State Department has characterized the initiative as a “good-will effort” aimed at combating extremism and fostering better relationships with Islamic communities. Officials argue that by investing in these renovations, the U.S. can help promote moderate voices within the Islamic community and discourage radicalization. However, this justification has not quelled the concerns of critics who question the effectiveness of such measures.

The broader narrative surrounding this funding initiative touches on issues of wealth redistribution to Islamic groups and the implications of demographic changes in the U.S. due to the influx of Muslim refugees. As the nation grapples with its identity and the challenges of integration, the allocation of taxpayer funds to foreign religious institutions has become a contentious topic. Many Americans are questioning the long-term impact of such financial decisions on the country's cultural landscape.

The controversy surrounding the mosque renovation funding is emblematic of a larger debate over the role of government spending in addressing both domestic and international issues. As taxpayers continue to voice their concerns, the pressure on lawmakers to reassess priorities and ensure that funds are allocated in a manner that reflects the needs of American citizens is likely to intensify.

As the dialogue continues, it remains to be seen how the government will respond to the criticisms and whether future spending will prioritize the needs of its citizens over foreign initiatives. The allocation of $770 million for mosque renovations serves as a stark reminder of the complexities involved in balancing international relations with domestic responsibilities. 

In conclusion, the fallout from the Obama administration's mosque renovation funding is far from over. As Americans navigate their own economic challenges, the question of how taxpayer money is spent will remain a focal point of discussion, with many advocating for a shift towards prioritizing domestic welfare over foreign investments.",-13.0,-14.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,649.0,-0.5833333333333334,-0.02157164869029276

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

By displaying their readiness to fight back, the Marines aim to undermine the terrorists' agenda, which thrives on fear.

Critics, particularly from liberal circles, have expressed anger over the billboard campaign, accusing it of prioritizing a confrontational approach over what they perceive as a need for terrorist appeasement. However, supporters argue that the message is clear: when people refuse to be afraid, terrorists lose their power. This sentiment resonates strongly in a society where fear can often dictate responses to threats.

The billboards not only convey a sense of strength and preparedness but also serve as a rallying point for those who believe in standing firm against terrorism. By showcasing the Marines' lack of fear, the campaign aims to inspire confidence among the public and reaffirm the commitment to self-defense.

As the nation grapples with the reality of terrorism, the decisive stance taken by the Marines through this campaign sends a powerful message. It asserts that the fight against groups like ISIS is not just a military engagement but a battle for the hearts and minds of the American people. The billboards are a testament to the Marines' readiness to confront those who seek to instill fear and disrupt the fabric of society.

In conclusion, the message against ISIS and similar terrorist organizations is clear and resolute. The Marines stand ready to protect the nation, and with this campaign, they challenge the narrative of fear that terrorists seek to propagate. The determination to confront these threats head-on not only reflects the Marines' commitment to their mission but also serves as a call to action for all Americans to stand united against the forces of terror.",-53.0,-35.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,452.0,-2.0588235294117645,-0.07743362831858407

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has been rocked by significant unrest as rioting has led to widespread disruption, looting, and violence throughout the city. In response to the escalating chaos, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency, signaling the seriousness of the situation and the need for immediate action.

To restore order, the governor has deployed the National Guard to assist local law enforcement in managing the unrest. This decision comes as officials grapple with the challenges posed by the riots, which have left many residents feeling unsafe and concerned about the implications for their community.

In a bold move to deter further violence, state officials announced that individuals caught participating in rioting or engaging in violent acts will face severe consequences, including the permanent revocation of their government benefits. This policy aims to discourage individuals from taking part in the unrest, as the potential loss of vital assistance could weigh heavily on those considering such actions.

The ramifications of this new policy extend beyond adults. Minor children who engage in violent behavior during the riots will also face significant consequences. Not only will they be held accountable for their actions, but their parents may also suffer the repercussions. Parents of minors involved in rioting may lose state benefits, face referrals to social services, and even risk losing custody of their children. This comprehensive approach underscores the state's commitment to addressing the root causes of the violence while holding families accountable.

City official Wilson Stewart emphasized the importance of parental responsibility in light of the ongoing situation. He urged parents to take an active role in monitoring their children's activities, stressing that involvement and vigilance are critical in preventing minors from becoming embroiled in the violence that has gripped the city. ""Parents must be aware of where their children are and who they are with,"" Stewart stated, highlighting the need for community cooperation in restoring peace.

To further curb the unrest, a mandatory curfew has been implemented across Charlotte. This measure aims to limit the movements of individuals during the late-night hours when violence has been most prevalent. Officials hope that by enforcing this curfew, they can help to restore a sense of safety and normalcy to the city.

As the situation continues to unfold, residents of Charlotte are left grappling with the consequences of the recent riots. The combination of state intervention, community responsibility, and the potential loss of government benefits serves as a stark reminder of the seriousness of the actions taken during these tumultuous times. With the National Guard on the ground and a curfew in place, city officials are hopeful that order will soon be restored, allowing Charlotte to heal from the turmoil that has disrupted its streets. 

The path forward remains uncertain, but the resolve of state officials and the community's commitment to restoring peace will be crucial in the days ahead.",-33.0,-22.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,544.0,-1.0476190476190477,-0.04044117647058824

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

FBI Director James Comey is facing mounting criticism regarding the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email scandal. The scrutiny intensified as details of the inquiry emerged, particularly concerning the immunity granted to Clinton's top aides, including her Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills. Mills has been accused of not fully cooperating with the investigation, raising questions about the integrity of the process.

The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28 to assess Comey's actions and determine his future in the role. This hearing is part of a broader congressional effort to investigate how the FBI handled the Clinton email investigation, which has become a contentious issue in the political landscape.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has been vocal in his criticism of Comey, calling for his resignation and questioning his fitness for office. DiGenova's remarks highlight concerns regarding the FBI's investigative procedures, particularly the decision not to convene a grand jury or issue a subpoena for Mills' computer. He suggested that these omissions indicate a lack of thoroughness in the investigation, further fueling the fire of discontent among critics.

As Congress prepares for its hearings, the atmosphere surrounding Comey has grown increasingly charged. Lawmakers are eager to delve into the specifics of the investigation and examine the decisions made by Comey and his team. The scrutiny is not merely about the investigation itself but also about the implications of Comey's actions on the credibility of the FBI and its leadership.

Adding to the complexity of the situation are questions regarding Comey's loyalty to Clinton. Critics are raising concerns about whether Comey’s decisions were influenced by political considerations, which could have significant consequences for his position as FBI Director. The ongoing investigation and the upcoming hearings could reveal more about the nature of the FBI's inquiry and Comey's role in it.

Comey has also been issued a subpoena by Congress to provide documents related to the email scandal. This subpoena comes in light of his failure to deliver requested materials previously, adding another layer of urgency to the congressional investigation. The expectation is that Comey will be held accountable for his actions, and the documents he provides may shed light on the decisions made during the investigation.

With the political stakes high and public interest piqued, the upcoming hearing on September 28 is poised to be a pivotal moment in the ongoing saga of the Clinton email investigation. As the inquiry unfolds, the spotlight remains firmly on Comey, whose future as FBI Director hangs in the balance as he navigates the intense scrutiny from both Congress and the public. The outcome of this investigation may have lasting implications not just for Comey, but for the integrity of the FBI itself.",-17.0,-18.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,516.0,-0.9,-0.03488372093023256

In a troubling intersection of politics and morality, the United States continues to maintain a close relationship with Saudi Arabia, a nation that has been a significant donor to political campaigns, including a reported 20% funding of Hillary Clinton's campaign. This financial influence raises serious questions about the ethical implications of U.S. support for a country with deep ties to terrorism and human rights violations.

The U.S. government’s ongoing support for Saudi Arabia comes under scrutiny, particularly in light of the historical context surrounding the 9/11 attacks. A significant number of the terrorists involved hailed from Saudi Arabia, prompting critical discussions about the implications of such ties. Despite this, the U.S. has not only continued its political and military alliances with the kingdom but has also turned a blind eye to the alarming activities that have emerged from within its borders.

Recent reports have surfaced accusing Saudi Arabia of publicly auctioning off sex slaves who were captured and exploited by the Islamic State (ISIS). This heinous practice has allegedly involved buyers from various backgrounds, including Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis, and even Westerners. The Islamic State has gained notoriety for its systematic abuse and trafficking of women, particularly targeting Yazidi girls, who have suffered unimaginable atrocities at the hands of the terrorist organization.

Eyewitness accounts from individuals who have witnessed the auctions describe a chilling scene where women are held in large rooms, stripped of their dignity and autonomy, and sold to the highest bidder. This grotesque commodification of human lives underscores the urgent need for global condemnation and action against such practices. The normalization of these auctions within the context of a broader conflict raises critical questions about the international community's responsibility to intervene.

In light of these grave human rights abuses, the article calls for a reevaluation of the U.S. and Britain’s arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The continued flow of weapons to a country that allegedly engages in and supports such atrocities is not only morally indefensible but also politically reckless. The complicity of U.S. politicians in this ongoing support raises significant concerns about accountability and the prioritization of political and financial interests over human rights.

The broader issue of human trafficking and the exploitation of women by ISIS is not merely a regional concern but a global crisis that demands attention. The systemic abuse of women, particularly in conflict zones, must be addressed with urgency and a commitment to justice. The U.S. and its allies have a moral obligation to take a stand against these violations and to support efforts aimed at dismantling the networks that facilitate such human trafficking.

As the international community grapples with the complexities of geopolitical alliances, it is imperative that the U.S. and Britain reassess their relationships with countries that engage in or support terrorism and human rights abuses. The current trajectory of support for Saudi Arabia, especially in the face of mounting evidence of its involvement in the trafficking and exploitation of women, is a stark reminder of the consequences of prioritizing political expediency over ethical considerations.

In conclusion, the need for accountability in the face of human rights abuses cannot be overstated. The U.S. must confront the uncomfortable truths surrounding its support for Saudi Arabia and take decisive action to end arms sales and political backing for a regime that stands accused of heinous crimes against humanity. The plight of women subjected to trafficking and abuse at the hands of ISIS and its affiliates is a call to action that should resonate with all who value human rights and dignity. The time for change is now; the world must not remain silent in the face of such atrocities.",-30.0,-20.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,682.0,-0.8695652173913043,-0.02932551319648094
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate of the election season unfolded with intense exchanges between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, captivating the attention of millions of viewers. The debate, moderated by NBC's Lester Holt, was marked by sharp disagreements and pointed questions that set the tone for a contentious political landscape.

As the debate progressed, Holt faced significant criticism for his handling of the discussion, particularly for his tendency to interrupt Trump in order to ""fact-check"" him. Many observers noted that several of Holt's fact-checks were inaccurate, raising questions about the moderator's impartiality and effectiveness. A particularly contentious moment arose when Holt asserted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from its inception. Trump vehemently denied this claim, leading to a back-and-forth exchange that highlighted the sharp divide between the two candidates.

In a notable aspect of the debate, Holt did not direct any questions toward Clinton regarding her own vote in favor of the Iraq War. Instead, the focus remained solely on Trump's alleged support for the military action. This selective questioning drew criticism from various commentators, who argued that it created an uneven playing field and failed to provide a comprehensive examination of both candidates' positions on foreign policy.

The debate's aftermath brought further scrutiny to Holt's claims. An interview aired shortly after the debate, featuring Trump expressing reservations about the invasion of Iraq. In this interview, Trump questioned the timing of the military action and suggested that it would have been prudent to wait for the United Nations to weigh in, contradicting Holt's assertion during the debate. This revelation added another layer of complexity to the narrative surrounding Trump's stance on the war.

Critics of the mainstream media voiced their concerns about the portrayal of Trump during the debate. Many argued that there was a concerted effort to discredit the Republican nominee rather than facilitate a substantive discussion on the issues at hand. This sentiment resonated with Trump's supporters, who viewed his ability to stand his ground against both Clinton and the media as a testament to his resilience in the face of scrutiny.

As the debate concluded, it was clear that both candidates had made their marks, but the dynamics of the debate raised important questions about the role of moderators and the media in shaping political discourse. With the election season heating up, the exchanges between Clinton and Trump are likely to set the stage for future debates and discussions as voters seek clarity on the candidates' positions and visions for the country.",-9.0,1.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,482.0,0.05555555555555555,0.002074688796680498
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

The Birther movement, which has stirred considerable debate over Barack Obama’s citizenship, continues to raise questions about the former president's narrative regarding his birthplace. A key piece of evidence often cited is a 2004 article from Breitbart, sourced from the Associated Press, that referred to Obama as ""Kenyan-born"" during his Senate campaign. This characterization has fueled ongoing speculation about the legitimacy of his citizenship.

During the 2004 Senate race, Obama’s main rival, Jack Ryan, withdrew from the competition due to a scandal, which allowed Obama to gain a significant advantage. It is noteworthy that throughout this period, Obama never refuted the claims made in the Breitbart article. This silence has led to further scrutiny and skepticism regarding his origins.

Adding to the controversy is a promotional booklet from 1991 produced by Obama’s literary agency. This booklet described Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii,” and was circulated among colleagues in the publishing industry to promote his anticipated first book. The language used in this document has raised eyebrows and sparked discussions about the accuracy of Obama’s statements regarding his birthplace.

The contradictions between Obama’s public narrative and the claims made in the 1991 booklet have led to questions about the authenticity of his citizenship. If it is accepted that Obama was indeed born in America, the assertions in the booklet could be interpreted as deceitful, suggesting he misrepresented his background for personal gain. Such a scenario raises ethical concerns about the integrity of his public persona.

Conversely, if the claims made in the 1991 booklet are validated, the implications for Obama’s citizenship become profound. This could potentially challenge his eligibility for the presidency, a matter that has been a focal point for the Birther movement since it gained traction. The ongoing debate underscores the complexities surrounding issues of identity, citizenship, and the narratives that public figures construct.

As the implications of these revelations continue to unfold, the Birther movement remains a contentious topic in American political discourse. The questions surrounding Barack Obama’s birthplace and citizenship are emblematic of larger conversations about race, identity, and the nature of political legitimacy in the United States. Whether viewed as a legitimate inquiry or a politically motivated attack, the Birther movement's impact on public perception and political dialogue is undeniable. The legacy of these discussions will likely persist as a significant chapter in the narrative of American politics.",-18.0,3.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,475.0,0.15789473684210525,0.00631578947368421

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In a recent debate, Hillary Clinton made headlines not only for her performance but also for a peculiar observation that has ignited a wave of speculation across social media platforms. Clinton appeared unusually composed throughout the event, notably refraining from coughing or reaching for water, a departure from her past debate performances that often included such interruptions.

However, the focus quickly shifted from her poise to an alleged flesh-colored device spotted in Clinton’s ear. This observation led to rampant theories among viewers and commentators, with many suggesting that the device could be an earpiece, potentially used for receiving assistance during the debate. Theories proliferated on social media, with some users humorously proposing that it might even be a ""Cough prevention machine,"" reflecting the public's appetite for sensational explanations.

Adding fuel to the fire, Clinton's campaign spokesperson, Nick Merrill, stepped in to address the swirling rumors. He firmly denied the earpiece claims, attributing the appearance of the device to a mere reflection from the television lights. Despite this explanation, the controversy did not dissipate. In fact, a leaked email from Clinton to her aide Huma Abedin, which mentioned an earpiece, raised further questions about the authenticity of Merrill's denial. This revelation has only intensified the debate surrounding the alleged device.

Commentator Woods added a layer of humor to the situation, suggesting that Clinton might need assistance to ""lie,"" implying that the former Secretary of State may not be entirely truthful about the device. This comment resonated with a segment of the audience that is skeptical of Clinton's transparency and honesty, further complicating her public image.

Despite the fervor surrounding the debate and the earpiece speculation, it is important to note that there is currently no definitive proof supporting the existence of such a device. Some observers argue that the object in question could simply be a hearing aid or, as Merrill suggested, merely a reflection from studio lighting. This lack of conclusive evidence leaves room for both sides of the argument, allowing the debate to continue in the public sphere.

As the debate aftermath unfolds, it is clear that the incident has sparked more than just a conversation about Clinton's debate performance. The speculation regarding the alleged earpiece has turned into a larger discussion about trust and transparency in political discourse. With the election season heating up, such controversies can have significant implications for candidates, potentially influencing public perception and voter sentiment.

In conclusion, while Hillary Clinton's debate performance was marked by an unusual calmness, the speculation surrounding a possible earpiece has overshadowed her achievements during the event. As social media buzzes with theories and humorous interpretations, the question remains: was it a simple reflection or something more? Only time will tell if this controversy will have any lasting impact on Clinton's campaign moving forward.",-5.0,-14.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,544.0,-0.6666666666666666,-0.025735294117647058
