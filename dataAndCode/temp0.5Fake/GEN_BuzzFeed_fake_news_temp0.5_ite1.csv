Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

In a recent statement, former President Bill Clinton acknowledged that it is ""natural"" for donors to the Clinton Foundation to seek favors, a remark that has raised eyebrows and concerns about its potential impact on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The statement aligns with ongoing accusations from Donald Trump, who has frequently suggested a pay-to-play scenario involving the Clinton Foundation. This development has intensified scrutiny on the former Secretary of State as she navigates the complexities of her campaign.

During an interview with NPR, Bill Clinton attempted to clarify his remarks, emphasizing that while it is common for donors to request favors, such requests do not equate to guaranteed outcomes. He reinforced that there is no evidence to support claims of pay-to-play activities within the Clinton Foundation. This assertion, however, has not quelled the concerns surrounding the implications of his statement, particularly in the context of the competitive political landscape.

Adding fuel to the fire, leaked emails have surfaced indicating that some Clinton Foundation donors received meetings with influential figures, while others were denied such access. This dichotomy has been interpreted by critics as supportive of the notion that favors may have been exchanged, despite the absence of concrete evidence linking donations to specific benefits. The narrative surrounding these emails has the potential to undermine Hillary Clinton’s campaign, especially as she seeks to present herself as a candidate of integrity and transparency.

In stark contrast to the scrutiny facing the Clinton Foundation, Donald Trump’s charitable foundation has come under its own set of investigations. Reports have surfaced indicating that Trump has not personally donated to his foundation since 2008, and allegations suggest that he may have used charitable funds for personal expenses. These revelations have prompted New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to launch an investigation into Trump's foundation for possible violations of New York charity laws. 

The juxtaposition of these two foundations has led to discussions about media coverage and perceived biases in reporting. Media Matters, a progressive media watchdog, has pointed out a double standard in how the media has handled the controversies surrounding Clinton and Trump. The organization notes that Clinton's health issues have garnered significantly more attention than the ongoing controversies related to Trump's charitable foundation. 

This disparity in coverage is believed to be detrimental to Hillary Clinton's campaign, particularly as she faces a resurgent Trump, who has gained momentum in recent weeks. The heightened scrutiny of Clinton's remarks and the ongoing narrative surrounding the Clinton Foundation may serve to reinforce the negative perceptions held by some voters, while Trump's controversies receive comparatively less media attention.

As the presidential race intensifies, the implications of Bill Clinton's statement and the surrounding controversies will likely continue to play a pivotal role in shaping public perception. The narrative of a pay-to-play scenario has the potential to resonate with voters who are wary of political corruption, while the contrasting issues faced by Trump’s foundation could complicate his efforts to position himself as a candidate of change.

Ultimately, the political landscape remains fluid, and how these issues are perceived by the electorate may significantly influence the trajectory of both candidates as they head toward the election. The stakes are high, and the interplay between media coverage, public perception, and campaign strategy will be critical in the coming months as both candidates work to solidify their positions and appeal to voters. 

In this charged political environment, both the Clinton and Trump campaigns will need to navigate the complexities of public perception and media narratives carefully. As the election approaches, the focus will undoubtedly remain on the implications of foundation activities and the broader questions of integrity and accountability in political fundraising.",6.0,2.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,690.0,0.08695652173913043,0.002898550724637681
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A draft congressional report has surfaced, claiming that the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa, potentially increasing the risks of morbidity and mortality among patients. This report, titled “The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, and it raises significant questions about the integrity of one of the Clinton Foundation’s most notable initiatives aimed at aiding AIDS victims.

CHAI has been recognized for its efforts in improving access to HIV/AIDS treatment, particularly in regions heavily impacted by the epidemic. However, the new findings cast a shadow over its operations, particularly concerning its relationship with Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, a key distributor of HIV/AIDS drugs for CHAI. The report brings to light the troubling history of Ranbaxy, which has faced serious allegations of quality control issues.

Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower and former employee of Ranbaxy, played a pivotal role in bringing these issues to the forefront. His actions helped the U.S. government initiate a lawsuit against the company, which ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to criminal charges related to fraud and the adulteration of drugs. This resulted in a staggering $500 million fine, highlighting the severity of the situation.

The Department of Justice has indicated that the diluted drugs produced by Ranbaxy posed increased health risks to patients, a revelation that has prompted Rep. Blackburn to question the number of patients potentially affected by these substandard medications. She has also raised concerns about the potential loss of lives due to the distribution of these ineffective treatments.

The report further scrutinizes the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, especially given the company's known quality control problems. Despite the alarming nature of these allegations, it remains unclear how many AIDS patients actually received the diluted drugs. Nonetheless, significant funding was allocated to Ranbaxy by U.S. aid agencies, which raises further questions about oversight and accountability.

Thakur has been vocal about the importance of drug quality in stabilizing health for AIDS patients, emphasizing the dangers associated with substandard medications. His warnings are particularly poignant in light of the fact that issues with Ranbaxy were first reported in 2004, with the FDA sending warning letters regarding quality control irregularities beginning in 2006.

Despite the serious concerns surrounding Ranbaxy's drug quality, CHAI has continued to distribute its HIV/AIDS medications abroad, even after the company's products were banned in the U.S. This ongoing distribution raises critical ethical questions about the foundation's commitment to patient safety and the efficacy of the treatments being provided.

In 2013, Bill Clinton publicly praised Ranbaxy, stating that their drugs had saved millions of lives. This endorsement stands in stark contrast to the allegations now being levied against the company and the implications for the patients who relied on these medications for their survival.

CHAI was part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, and while it has since been separated, there remains an overlap in board members and staff between the two entities. This connection raises additional concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the governance of health initiatives under the Clinton umbrella.

The congressional study also delves into allegations that Bill Clinton may have relaxed quality standards through a 2000 executive order regarding intellectual property laws for HIV/AIDS medicines in sub-Saharan Africa. Such actions, if proven true, could have significant implications for the foundation's operations and its role in the global fight against AIDS.

Furthermore, the report examines potential corruption within the program and how it may have financially benefited the Clinton Foundation. Relationships with Indian-American businessmen involved in the American Indian Foundation, co-founded by Clinton, are also under scrutiny, raising ethical concerns about the intertwining of business and humanitarian efforts.

Rep. Blackburn has expressed particular concern over the emotional impact of false hopes on patients and healthcare workers, stemming from the distribution of ineffective treatments. The ramifications of these findings, if substantiated, could be profound, affecting not only the reputation of the Clinton Foundation and CHAI but also the lives of countless individuals who depend on effective HIV/AIDS treatment.

As the congressional investigation unfolds, the implications of this report will likely resonate far beyond the political sphere, potentially affecting public trust in health initiatives and the organizations that support them. The scrutiny of CHAI's practices and its relationship with Ranbaxy serves as a stark reminder of the importance of accountability in healthcare, especially in regions where access to effective treatment is not just a matter of health but of life and death.

In conclusion, the draft congressional report initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn raises serious allegations against the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its collaboration with Ranbaxy. The implications of distributing ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications could have devastating effects on patient health, and the ongoing investigation will likely reveal more about the intersection of health, ethics, and politics in the realm of global health initiatives. As stakeholders await further developments, the focus remains on ensuring that quality and integrity are prioritized in the fight against HIV/AIDS.",-6.0,5.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,944.0,0.15625,0.005296610169491525
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van after attending the 9/11 ceremony in New York City. This incident has raised eyebrows and sparked a wave of speculation regarding her health and future public appearances.

Shortly after the collapse, Clinton made an appearance at the apartment of her daughter, Chelsea Clinton. However, observers noted that she looked significantly different from her usual self. Witnesses described her as appearing more energetic and lighter, with a notable change in her facial features, particularly her nose. The nose of the woman seen at the apartment was characterized as having a Roman type, which stands in stark contrast to Hillary's known Nordic nose. This discrepancy has led to further conjecture about the identity of the woman who emerged from Chelsea’s residence.

Additionally, those familiar with Hillary Clinton's appearance noted that the woman at the apartment appeared younger and lacked a distinctive mole that Hillary has above her right lip. This has fueled theories that the individual seen after the ceremony may not have been the real Hillary Clinton but rather a stand-in or clone. As speculation mounts, some are suggesting that this clone could handle most of Clinton's public appearances, particularly given her recent health issues.

The implications of this speculation are profound, particularly as the political landscape heats up with the upcoming debates against Donald Trump. Questions are emerging about Hillary's capacity to participate in these pivotal events. Observers are being advised to pay close attention to any changes in her appearance, such as noticeable weight loss or a more youthful look, as potential indicators of the clone's presence.

Concerns have also been raised about whether the real Hillary Clinton will be seen or heard if she is elected President. The possibility that her double could conduct all public duties has led to a growing sense of unease among her supporters and critics alike. The notion of a Clinton Administration operating without Hillary herself has ignited discussions about the authenticity of political leadership in contemporary times.

Drawing parallels with President Obama, the author of this article suggests that a similar mystery surrounds leadership and the individuals who occupy these high offices. The idea that a leader may not be fully present, or that a substitute could be managing public duties, raises fundamental questions about accountability and representation in government.

It is essential to note that the views expressed in this article reflect the author's perspective and may not necessarily align with the beliefs of the publication. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the questions surrounding Hillary Clinton's health and the authenticity of her public appearances remain a topic of intense debate and scrutiny. As voters prepare for the upcoming election, the implications of these speculations will undoubtedly influence public perception and the political narrative moving forward. 

As the election draws nearer, it remains to be seen how these developments will impact Clinton’s campaign and her ability to engage with the electorate. The political arena is rife with uncertainty, and the situation surrounding Hillary Clinton serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges faced by public figures in the modern age.",8.0,9.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,598.0,0.391304347826087,0.015050167224080268
Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

In the heated political landscape of the United States, former President Donald Trump has made headlines with his contentious views on immigration and terrorism. His statements have sparked widespread debate and concern among various segments of the population, particularly regarding their implications for American Muslims and the broader immigrant community.

Trump's rhetoric has often included inflammatory language surrounding immigration, particularly when discussing individuals from Mexico. He famously proposed the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, characterizing some immigrants as ""rapists"" and ""drug dealers."" This framing has not only intensified the national conversation on immigration but has also raised questions about the underlying messages conveyed about entire communities.

One of the more alarming proposals from Trump has been the suggestion of establishing a national registry for Muslims. This idea draws disturbing parallels to historical actions taken against Jewish populations during World War II and has led to significant backlash from civil rights advocates. Furthermore, Trump has hinted at the possibility of creating modern-day concentration camps for Muslims, a notion that has been met with outrage and condemnation from various quarters of society.

In addition to these proposals, Trump has made statements suggesting that the families of terrorists should face lethal consequences. He argued that terrorists are deeply connected to their families and, therefore, their loved ones should be held accountable. This perspective raises ethical concerns about collective punishment and the potential violation of fundamental human rights.

Trump's Senior Communications Advisor has indicated that the former president is more focused on countering the narratives of former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton than on addressing the actual threat of terrorism. This approach has led to questions about the effectiveness and sincerity of Trump's proposed strategies for combating terrorism, given the complex nature of the issue.

The former president has been vocal in his criticism of the increase in immigrants from countries he deems dangerous, particularly in the context of Syrian refugees. He has laid blame for the rise in radical Islamic terrorism squarely at the feet of Obama and Clinton, asserting that their policies have contributed to a more dangerous world. This stance plays into a larger narrative that seeks to link immigration directly with terrorism, despite evidence suggesting that the vast majority of immigrants, including refugees, are not involved in criminal activities.

Trump's belief that terrorists pose an existential threat to the United States has fueled his calls for preemptive measures to eliminate them before they can inflict harm on American citizens. This perspective reflects a broader trend in political discourse where security concerns often overshadow civil liberties and the rights of individuals.

Moreover, Trump has previously accused the Muslim community of harboring terrorists, suggesting that Muslims should be vigilant and report suspicious activities. This assertion has raised concerns about the potential stigmatization of Muslims in America and the implications for community relations. Critics argue that such rhetoric fosters an environment of fear and suspicion, which could lead to increased discrimination and violence against innocent individuals based solely on their faith.

As Trump's rhetoric continues to evolve, there are growing concerns about how he would define terrorism and the potential ramifications for Muslims living in America. The lack of clarity around his definitions raises alarms about the risk of broadening the scope of what constitutes terrorism, potentially leading to unjust targeting of specific communities.

It is essential to note that while Trump’s focus has been on external threats, recent attacks have been committed by American citizens, highlighting the complexities of domestic terrorism. This reality serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding constitutional rights for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. The implications of Trump's policies and statements could have far-reaching consequences for civil liberties in the United States, particularly for marginalized communities.

As the nation gears up for the upcoming elections, the stakes are high. The rhetoric employed by political leaders can shape public perception and influence policy decisions that affect millions of lives. The author warns against the potential consequences of a Trump presidency, suggesting that his approach to immigration and terrorism could lead to severe ramifications for democracy and civil rights in America.

Voter participation in the upcoming election is crucial, as citizens must weigh the implications of the candidates' positions on immigration and terrorism. The choices made at the ballot box will not only determine the direction of national policy but also reflect the values that Americans hold dear regarding inclusivity, justice, and human rights.

In conclusion, Donald Trump's controversial statements and proposals regarding immigration and terrorism have ignited a national conversation about the balance between security and civil liberties. As the political landscape continues to evolve, it is imperative for voters to remain informed and engaged, ensuring that the principles of justice and equality are upheld in the face of divisive rhetoric. The future of American democracy may very well depend on the choices made in the coming election.",-71.0,-32.0,888.0,-2.2903225806451615,-0.07995495495495496,921.0,-0.9411764705882353,-0.03474484256243214

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, advocating for One World Government and globalization.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Allegations of pay-to-play corruption have emerged involving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation, raising questions about the organization's financial practices and its true purpose. Critics argue that the foundation has primarily functioned as a profit-making entity for the Clintons and their associates, rather than a legitimate charitable organization.

In response to these allegations, the Clinton campaign has emphasized the foundation's positive contributions to global health and development, asserting that it has played a vital role in addressing pressing issues. However, scrutiny of the foundation's financial records reveals a troubling picture. According to IRS filings from 2014, only 5.7% of the foundation's budget was allocated to charitable grants, a stark contrast to the organization's purported mission.

The foundation's total spending in 2014 amounted to just under $91.3 million, yet less than $5.2 million of that figure was directed toward charitable grants. A significant portion of the budget, $34.8 million, was spent on salaries and employee benefits, while over $50 million was allocated to ""other expenses."" This distribution of funds has raised eyebrows among watchdogs and critics alike, who question whether the foundation is genuinely committed to charitable causes.

Further compounding concerns, charitable spending decreased by 40% in 2014 compared to the previous year, despite an increase of $30 million in income. This decline in charitable contributions, juxtaposed with a $5 million rise in salaries and employee compensation, has led many to speculate about the foundation's priorities. The increase in ""other expenses"" alongside growing compensation for staff members has fueled accusations that the Clintons are leveraging their political influence to amass wealth.

The implications of these financial practices suggest a troubling narrative: that the Clinton Foundation may be more about enriching the Clintons and their associates than about making a meaningful impact in the world. As the allegations of pay-to-play corruption continue to circulate, the foundation's ability to maintain a charitable appearance while allocating resources primarily for its own operational costs comes under increasing scrutiny.

In conclusion, the situation surrounding the Clinton Foundation reflects a potential scheme for the Clintons to accumulate wealth through political influence. As the debate unfolds, the foundation's future and its role in global philanthropy remain uncertain, casting a shadow over its legacy.",25.0,11.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,437.0,0.7333333333333333,0.02517162471395881
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

During that event, Clinton experienced a convulsion and had to be assisted into her van, prompting her campaign to initially attribute the episode to heat. However, it was later revealed that the temperature in NYC was a mild 74 degrees, raising eyebrows about the explanation.

The Greensboro rally has since come under scrutiny, with questions about its authenticity surfacing. Observers noted the presence of unusual cameras aimed at the audience, which led to speculation that the event may have been staged. Compounding these concerns, a video analysis surfaced, claiming to provide evidence of a faked audience during the rally.

Despite the controversy, a C-Span video was referenced to assert that nothing had been altered in the footage discussed, suggesting that the claims of staging might lack solid evidence. As Clinton continues her campaign, the incident and the subsequent rally have sparked a debate about transparency and authenticity in political events, leaving many to wonder about the implications for her campaign moving forward. The Greensboro rally, intended as a display of resilience, now appears to be mired in uncertainty amid ongoing discussions about the nature of political appearances in the current climate.",4.0,-2.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,248.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.008064516129032258
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the release date for the satirical film ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" approaches, anticipation is building among audiences eager to see a comedic take on the health and media portrayal of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The film promises to delve into the controversial narrative surrounding Clinton, particularly her recent health incidents and the media's seemingly supportive stance.

Critics have long argued that the media has crafted a narrative around Clinton that downplays any serious health issues she may be experiencing. This sentiment is echoed by those who claim that Clinton is severely ill, pointing to her recent health incidents, including what has been described as a ""minor case of pneumonia."" Such incidents have raised eyebrows and sparked discussions about the transparency of her health status.

Adding to the intrigue is the presence of a traveling physician who has been closely associated with the Clintons since 2003. Speculation surrounds this physician, with some suggesting that he carries a Diazepam pen, a medication typically used for seizure management. This raises questions about the severity of Clinton's health issues and the lengths to which her campaign might go to manage public perception.

Another focal point of discussion is Clinton's decision to wear blue-tinted glasses, which some believe are linked to treatments for seizure disorders or even Parkinson’s disease. This choice has fueled further speculation about her health and has led to calls for greater transparency from her campaign regarding her medical condition.

Despite the growing concerns, it is anticipated that the Clinton campaign will not address these issues openly. The need for transparency has never been more critical, yet it seems unlikely that the campaign will take the necessary steps to reassure the public about her health.

Clinton's perceived dishonesty regarding her health and other matters has also had a significant impact on her approval ratings. Many voters are becoming increasingly wary of her credibility, particularly in light of her recent medical crisis and controversial remarks about supporters of her political opponent, Donald Trump. This drop in poll numbers highlights the potential consequences of a lack of transparency and the erosion of trust among constituents.

The political landscape is further complicated by accusations of hypocrisy regarding Clinton's comments on racism. Critics have pointed to her past associations and the history of her party as evidence of a double standard, casting doubt on her sincerity when addressing such important social issues. This has led to a broader discussion about the implications of her words and actions on her political viability.

Despite the controversies and health concerns, there remains a sense of compassion for Clinton as a person, separate from her political actions. Many observers acknowledge the challenges she faces, both in terms of her health and her political career. This duality of sentiment reflects a complex relationship with the former Secretary of State, where personal well-being is often weighed against political aspirations.

Speculation continues regarding Clinton's potential to win the presidency, even amidst her health issues and the media's support. Some believe that her established political connections and experience could still propel her forward, regardless of the controversies surrounding her. However, this optimism is tempered by concerns about her health and the implications it may have on her campaign.

As discussions around Clinton's future unfold, there is a palpable hope for the decline of her political career. Many express a desire for her to step back from the political spotlight, while also wishing for her personal well-being in the years to come. This duality reflects a broader sentiment within the electorate, where political opinions are often intertwined with personal feelings about public figures.

In conclusion, the anticipation for ""Weekend at Chelsea's"" serves as a backdrop to the ongoing discussions about Hillary Clinton's health and media portrayal. The film is expected to shed light on the complexities surrounding her public image, while the political implications of her health continue to unfold. As the narrative develops, it remains to be seen how Clinton will navigate the challenges ahead, both personally and politically.

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In what was intended to be his final address to the United Nations Assembly, former President Barack Obama delivered a poignant message that underscored the complexities of global conflicts and the limitations of military power in combating radical extremism. The address, marked by a candid assessment of the challenges posed by ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups, reflected a deep concern about the efficacy of U.S. efforts in the region.

Obama expressed significant doubts regarding the United States' ability to effectively defeat ISIS, describing the group and similar factions as part of a ""JV team"" that exploits the vulnerabilities of various communities. This characterization highlighted the shortcomings of military interventions, suggesting that brute force alone is insufficient to address the underlying issues that fuel such extremism.

Central to his message was the assertion that no external power can impose coexistence among diverse religious and ethnic communities. Obama emphasized the importance of acknowledging the nature of conflicts honestly, arguing that a failure to do so could lead to misguided strategies and ineffective responses. He advocated for a shift in approach, promoting diplomacy as a more viable solution to the crises in Syria and the broader fight against ISIS.

In his address, Obama called for supporting political settlements and providing aid to those in need, stressing that sustainable peace cannot be achieved through military dominance alone. This plea for a diplomatic resolution was accompanied by a critique of liberal perspectives that tend to downplay the threats posed by radical Islam. He cautioned that such complacency could have dire consequences, urging leaders and citizens alike to recognize the gravity of the situation.

The former president's warnings resonated with urgency as he urged for immediate action against radical Islam. He criticized the tendency to maintain a polite stance in discussions surrounding extremism, arguing that this approach could hinder effective responses to the real threats facing global security. Obama's insistence on the need for a proactive strategy reflected his broader belief that addressing the root causes of conflict and fostering dialogue among communities are essential steps toward lasting peace.

Obama's address served as a sobering reminder of the complexities of modern warfare and the multifaceted nature of global conflicts. As he concluded his speech, the former president left the assembly with a clear message: the path forward requires honesty, a commitment to diplomacy, and a recognition of the urgent need to confront the realities of radical extremism head-on.

In a world increasingly defined by division and strife, Obama's reflections on the limitations of military power and the necessity of collaborative efforts to foster understanding among diverse communities stand as a call to action for leaders and citizens alike. His final address to the U.N. was not just a farewell, but a poignant reminder of the ongoing challenges that demand thoughtful and immediate responses in the pursuit of global peace and security.",-5.0,-7.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,541.0,-0.4117647058823529,-0.012939001848428836
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Recent declassified Defense Intelligence documents have unveiled troubling connections between the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) and actions taken by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) since 2012. The revelations suggest that the Obama Administration may have intentionally fostered conditions that would isolate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government, inadvertently paving the way for ISIS’s emergence.

Investigative journalist Nafeez Ahmed has highlighted that Western, Turkish, and Gulf state support for Takfiri militants was anticipated to result in the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. This support, aimed at destabilizing Assad’s regime, was seen as a strategic move that ultimately contributed to the rise of violent Islamist groups and the subsequent emergence of an 'Islamic State' in both Iraq and Syria.

Critics have pointed to President Obama’s characterization of ISIS as a “JV” team as a significant miscalculation. Furthermore, the decision not to maintain a residual military presence in Iraq has been scrutinized, with many arguing that these choices underestimated the threat posed by the group and its potential for expansion.

The newly released documents also provide insight into U.S. weapons operations in Libya prior to the 2012 Benghazi attack. They indicate that there was awareness of weapons being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports, raising questions about the implications of these actions on regional stability.

The report suggests that American servicemen and women were effectively sacrificed due to a covert Middle Eastern policy that prioritized concealment over national security. This approach has drawn criticism for allowing the rise of ISIS, calling into question the strategic decisions made by U.S. leadership during this tumultuous period.

As the implications of these revelations continue to unfold, they highlight the complex and often contradictory nature of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly regarding the fight against terrorism and the unintended consequences of supporting certain factions within the region. The documents serve as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by policymakers in navigating the intricate dynamics of international relations.",-27.0,2.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,388.0,0.16666666666666666,0.005154639175257732
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a startling turn of events, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed before entering her van following a memorial ceremony for the September 11 attacks in New York City. The incident has sparked widespread speculation regarding her health and the authenticity of her public appearances.

Shortly after her collapse, Clinton was seen at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment. Observers noted a significant transformation in her appearance—she appeared lighter, more vibrant, and notably different from her usual self. This drastic change has led some to question whether the woman seen exiting the van was indeed the real Hillary Clinton or a possible stand-in.

Eyewitness accounts have pointed out a change in Clinton's facial features, particularly her nose shape. The former Secretary of State is known for having a Nordic nose, while the individual who appeared at Chelsea's apartment exhibited a Roman-type nose. This discrepancy has fueled speculation among observers, with some suggesting that the person seen in Chelsea's apartment could be a ""clone"" or a double.

Adding to the intrigue, the clone—or the individual speculated to be a double—appeared younger than the Hillary Clinton the public has known. Notably, this figure lacked the distinctive mole above the lip that has been a recognizable feature of the real Hillary Clinton. These observations have led to further questions about the authenticity of her public image and whether the real Hillary Clinton is still able to engage in her political career.

As the presidential campaign heats up, concerns have emerged regarding Clinton's ability to campaign effectively and participate in potential debates against her political rival, Donald Trump. Observers are encouraged to remain vigilant for signs that may indicate the presence of a double, such as a thinner appearance or an absence of health-related issues that have been previously associated with the former First Lady.

The implications of this situation extend beyond mere speculation about her health. There are growing concerns about whether the real Hillary Clinton will be involved in her potential presidency should she win the election, or if her double will take on public roles in her stead. This raises significant questions about the authenticity of leadership and the potential for a Clinton Administration to operate without the actual Hillary Clinton at the helm.

The political landscape is fraught with uncertainty as these developments unfold. The possibility that the public may not be seeing the real Hillary Clinton has raised alarms among her supporters and critics alike. As the campaign progresses, the scrutiny on her appearances is likely to intensify, with many watching closely for any signs that might confirm or dispel the theories surrounding her health and identity.

This situation has not only captured the attention of political analysts but also the general public, who are left grappling with the implications of such claims. The discourse surrounding Clinton's health and appearance is emblematic of the broader concerns regarding transparency in politics and the lengths to which public figures may go to maintain their image.

As the story develops, it remains to be seen how Clinton will address these speculations and whether she will provide clarity on her health and public appearances. For now, the questions linger, and the public remains captivated by the mystery surrounding one of America's most prominent political figures.

Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Concerns about Hillary Clinton's health are escalating, fueled by recent rumors suggesting she may be experiencing a nervous breakdown. The speculation intensified following the release of a video that appeared to show Clinton struggling with her eye movements, raising eyebrows among supporters and critics alike.

Adding to the intrigue, Clinton abruptly canceled a fundraiser in North Carolina on the same day as the video incident, further igniting discussions about her well-being. Observers noted that between September 20 and October 19, Clinton has only one rally scheduled, with no speaking engagements announced for fundraisers during that period. This stark contrast is evident when compared to Donald Trump, who has four rallies planned between September 20 and 22, highlighting a noticeable disparity in campaign activity.

Reports indicate that Clinton's health issues may be more pronounced than previously thought. At a recent rally, she reportedly required Secret Service assistance to navigate just two steps, raising alarm among her supporters. As these health concerns continue to mount, predictions suggest that Clinton's struggles may soon become publicly evident, leading to increased scrutiny from both the media and the public.

In light of these developments, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is reportedly exploring potential replacements for Clinton. However, the situation is complicated by Bernie Sanders' apparent lack of enthusiasm for running for president, leaving the DNC in a precarious position. Despite the emerging health concerns, the DNC has maintained that Clinton remains the best and only choice for the party, a stance that may soon be tested as her health becomes a more pressing issue.

The implications of a potential health cover-up are significant, with analysts warning that such revelations could severely damage the Democratic Party's reputation. As the situation unfolds, more developments are anticipated in the coming days, with the political landscape possibly shifting dramatically based on Clinton's health status.

As the party navigates these turbulent waters, many are left wondering how the DNC will reconcile its commitment to Clinton with the growing concerns about her fitness to campaign effectively. The coming weeks will be critical in determining not only Clinton's political future but also the overall stability of the Democratic Party as it heads into a pivotal election season.",-8.0,-5.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,422.0,-0.3333333333333333,-0.011848341232227487
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In the quiet hours of the night, when the world outside was draped in darkness, former President Barack Obama found himself wrestling with insomnia. The peaceful slumber of his wife, Michelle, was disrupted only by the rhythmic sound of her loud snoring. As he lay awake, a sense of sadness and nervousness washed over him. Seeking solace, he wandered the familiar halls of the West Wing, a place filled with memories of his presidency and the weight of decisions that shaped the nation.

As he meandered through the dimly lit corridors, a word caught his eye—“ISIS.” It was a term that had become synonymous with fear and chaos in the global landscape. Intrigued and perhaps inspired, he reached for a nearby Post-It note and jotted down the word, unaware of the profound implications it would soon bear on his life.

Months later, the vibrant atmosphere of Coachella enveloped him. The music pulsed through the air, and the energy of the festival was infectious. Amidst the revelry, a thought began to take shape in his mind—an idea so radical it bordered on the absurd. What if he could start an international terrorist organization? With the seed of this unconventional notion planted, Obama contemplated the possibility of becoming the first American president to lead such a group, which he would name ISIS.

Initially, the idea was met with skepticism when he shared it with those around him. Friends and advisors raised their eyebrows, unsure of how to respond to such a shocking proposition. However, Obama felt a certain kinship with Hillary Clinton, believing she could be the confidante he needed to discuss his unorthodox aspirations. 

One late night, under the stars and surrounded by the tranquility of the Rose Garden, Obama invited Hillary for a candid conversation. The air was thick with anticipation as he prepared to unveil his secret identity. With a mix of seriousness and humor, he revealed that he was, in fact, a 97-year-old Kenyan man sent to destroy America. The statement hung in the air, and for a moment, silence reigned.

Hillary’s reaction was one of disbelief and confusion. “What do you mean you’re a 97-year-old Kenyan man?” she questioned, her brow furrowing in perplexity. “And what about Bo?” she added, referring to Obama’s beloved dog. “You can’t expect me to believe that your dog is a supercomputer!”

The absurdity of the situation sparked laughter between the two, easing the tension that had built up. As they snacked on treats and sipped drinks, the conversation shifted to the plans for ISIS. They discussed the intricacies of the organization, the challenges they might face, and the potential for chaos that could ensue. The laughter and camaraderie made the daunting prospect feel less intimidating, as if they were merely plotting a playful prank rather than a serious endeavor.

Intrigued by the possibilities, Hillary proposed a strategic approach: “Why don’t we wait until I become president? Then we can secretly destroy America together.” The suggestion ignited a spark of excitement in Obama. For the first time, he felt understood, as if someone else shared his vision, no matter how outlandish it seemed.

As the night wore on and the first light of dawn began to creep into the sky, the two political figures lay back in the grass, contemplating their plans. The stars above twinkled like distant dreams, and the weight of their ambitions momentarily lifted. In that serene moment, they found a connection that transcended the political realm, bonding over the absurdity of their shared aspirations.

The sun began to rise, casting a warm glow over the Rose Garden, a place that had witnessed countless significant moments in their lives. As they lay there, they understood that their conversation, while rooted in the fantastical, was a reflection of the complexities of their lives as public figures. The world outside would never know the depths of their late-night musings, nor the laughter that echoed through the garden.

In the end, Obama’s late-night insomnia and Michelle’s snoring had led him down an unexpected path of imagination and camaraderie. It was a journey filled with laughter, absurdity, and the fleeting nature of dreams shared between two political titans. Though their plans for ISIS remained a whimsical fantasy, the bond forged in those early morning hours would linger, a testament to the power of friendship and the human capacity for creativity, even in the most unlikely of circumstances.",-4.0,7.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,871.0,0.1891891891891892,0.008036739380022962
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the wake of recent attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, Frank Wilkenmeyer has raised critical questions about Donald Trump’s bold assertion to ""destroy"" terrorism in the United States. As Trump’s campaign rhetoric intensifies, it becomes increasingly important to examine the implications of such statements, particularly in light of their potential impact on civil liberties and the fabric of American society.

Trump's declaration was not just a promise to combat terrorism; it was accompanied by personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton. This tactic of vilifying political opponents serves to galvanize his base but also raises alarms about the divisive nature of his campaign. By framing the issue in such stark terms, Trump not only simplifies a complex problem but also risks fostering an environment of fear and mistrust.

Wilkenmeyer emphasizes that the promise to eliminate all terrorists and eradicate terrorism entirely is fraught with complications. One of the most pressing concerns is the potential for profiling and violations of civil rights. In a fervent quest to root out threats, there is a danger that innocent individuals, particularly those from Muslim communities, could find themselves unjustly targeted. This raises ethical questions about the balance between national security and the protection of individual rights.

Moreover, Wilkenmeyer warns of the implications of increased surveillance and the potential for segregation in neighborhoods with significant Muslim populations. Such measures could lead to a chilling atmosphere where individuals are monitored not for their actions but for their identities. The specter of profiling looms large, threatening to undermine the very principles of equality and justice that are foundational to American democracy.

The author critiques Trump’s rhetoric as leaning towards fascism, drawing parallels to historical instances where fear was weaponized to justify oppressive measures. The language used by Trump echoes sentiments from the past, where the promise of safety was leveraged to erode civil liberties. This historical context serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the fragility of democratic values in the face of fearmongering.

Wilkenmeyer argues that the notion of simply ""destroying"" terrorism through proclamations is not only naive but also reminiscent of previous failed promises made by politicians. The complexities of terrorism cannot be addressed through simplistic solutions or grandstanding. It requires a nuanced understanding of the underlying issues, a commitment to due process, and a recognition of the diverse factors that contribute to radicalization.

In portraying Trump as a figure who exploits fear and appeals to a misguided base, the article underscores the responsibility of leaders to foster unity rather than division. The rhetoric of fear may resonate with some, but it ultimately detracts from constructive dialogue and meaningful solutions. By framing the fight against terrorism as a battle against an abstract enemy, Trump risks alienating communities and perpetuating cycles of mistrust.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial for voters to critically assess the implications of such rhetoric. The challenge lies not only in combating terrorism but also in preserving the values that define the nation. Wilkenmeyer’s insights serve as a reminder that the fight against extremism must be rooted in principles of justice and respect for all individuals.

In conclusion, Frank Wilkenmeyer's examination of Trump’s promise to ""destroy"" terrorism highlights the potential dangers of such rhetoric. The call for increased surveillance, profiling, and the erosion of civil rights poses a significant threat to the fabric of American society. As the nation grapples with the complexities of terrorism, it is imperative to approach the issue with a commitment to due process and an unwavering dedication to the principles of democracy. The fight against terrorism cannot be won through fear; it requires understanding, unity, and a steadfast commitment to justice for all.",-28.0,-17.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,706.0,-0.6071428571428571,-0.024079320113314446

Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno has issued a stark warning regarding the current state of military readiness in the United States, highlighting the dangerous tipping point posed by escalating global terrorism and increasing hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea. In a candid assessment, Odierno expressed concern that the Army is only generating sufficient readiness to meet immediate operational needs, cautioning that further reductions in military capacity are unsustainable.

The general pointed to a significant disconnect between the current administration and military leadership, attributing this gap to the Obama Administration's historical disregard for military advice and strategies. This disconnect, he argues, has contributed to the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and North Africa, underscoring the consequences of ignoring military expertise in strategic decision-making.

Odierno did not shy away from criticizing the administration, labeling its approach as marked by incompetence and arrogance, which he claims has adversely affected the careers of military personnel. He emphasized that the United States is facing serious global challenges and determined adversaries that threaten both national and allied security.

In recent years, the Army has made significant cuts to its active force, reducing troop levels by 80,000 soldiers. Additionally, the service has reorganized and eliminated 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades. These reductions have raised concerns about the Army's ability to respond effectively to emerging threats.

The general also pointed out a troubling trend in investment, noting a 25% decrease in funding for Army modernization efforts. This decline has had a direct impact on critical development programs, including those for infantry fighting vehicles and scout helicopters, which are essential for maintaining operational effectiveness in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.

As the U.S. military grapples with these challenges, Odierno's warnings serve as a call to action for policymakers to reassess priorities and ensure that the Army is adequately prepared to face the complexities of modern warfare.",-4.0,-17.0,364.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.01098901098901099,365.0,-1.4166666666666667,-0.04657534246575343

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.

Concerns are particularly focused on how this shift could empower nations such as Russia, China, and Iran to impose censorship on online discourse, potentially impacting American citizens by blocking access to specific websites. The senator argues that this proposal poses a significant threat to the fundamental freedoms that many Americans cherish. Alarmingly, it appears that a considerable portion of the American public remains unaware of the potential consequences of this change.

With the proposed transition set to take effect on September 30, 2016, there is a growing sense of urgency for Congress to take action. Cruz's opposition highlights the critical discussions surrounding internet governance and the implications for global free speech as the deadline approaches.",3.0,6.0,218.0,0.2727272727272727,0.013761467889908258,200.0,0.8571428571428571,0.03
Fake_26-Webpage,Clemson BANS Memes Featuring Dead Gorilla Harambe…Promotes “Rape Culture” and “Racism” – Eagle Rising,"Clemson University freshmen may no longer publicly display Harambe-related memes because they “add to rape culture” and can be “a form of racism.”

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the November elections approach, the landscape of American democracy is under scrutiny, and the importance of adhering to proper election procedures has never been more critical. Every state has established laws governing election methods and procedures, designed to ensure that the electoral process is fair and transparent. However, concerns have been raised about the integrity of these processes, particularly regarding allegations of voter fraud and the potential for manipulation.

The author, a self-identified Christian and Constitutional Conservative, expresses a deep-seated belief that the National Democratic Party is not just a political organization but a ""powerful hate group"" intent on undermining the democratic process. This perspective is rooted in the conviction that the Democratic Party is working towards establishing a socialist dictatorship in the United States. This assertion is accompanied by serious allegations, including claims of voter fraud and ballot stuffing, particularly referencing the 2016 election where Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee.

In the author's view, the integrity of elections is paramount. Proper election procedures should not only encourage participation from all citizens but also implement measures that prevent voting fraud. A key recommendation made by the author is the requirement of photo identification to verify voter eligibility and citizenship. This measure is seen as a necessary step to ensure that only eligible voters are allowed to cast their ballots. However, the author criticizes the Democratic Party for opposing voter ID laws, suggesting that this opposition is a deliberate strategy to allow potentially ineligible voters to participate in the electoral process.

The author further alleges that various institutions, including the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, Congress, and federal courts, are actively suppressing fair election practices. This claim underscores a growing concern among certain segments of the population regarding the perceived erosion of electoral integrity. It is within this context that the author calls upon citizens to take an active role in safeguarding the democratic process. The author encourages individuals to volunteer as monitors at polling places during the upcoming elections, emphasizing the importance of vigilance in preventing voter fraud.

In a broader political context, Donald Trump is portrayed positively by the author, who views him as a leader on a mission to save the country from what they describe as tyranny. The author's support for Trump is intertwined with their call to action, as they urge citizens to remain alert and proactive in monitoring the electoral process. The stakes are framed as particularly high, with the author asserting that November 8, 2016, is a crucial date for the preservation of the republic. This date is positioned as a pivotal moment in American history, where citizens must rise to the occasion to ensure that elections are conducted fairly and without interference.

The views expressed in this call to action are deeply personal to the author and reflect a broader sentiment among those who share similar beliefs. It is important to note that these opinions are solely those of the author and are not necessarily endorsed by EagleRising.com. The emphasis on individual responsibility and active participation in the electoral process resonates with many who are concerned about the future of American democracy.

As the election date draws nearer, the conversation surrounding voter integrity, election laws, and the role of political parties intensifies. Citizens are encouraged to engage in discussions about the importance of maintaining a fair electoral process, while also considering the implications of various policies and practices that could affect the outcome of elections. The author's passionate appeal serves as a reminder that in a democracy, the responsibility to protect the integrity of elections lies not only with lawmakers but also with the electorate itself.

In conclusion, as the November elections approach, the call for vigilance and active participation in monitoring polling places is a clarion call for citizens to take ownership of their democracy. The author's perspective highlights a critical intersection of faith, politics, and civic duty, urging Americans to stand guard over the electoral process to ensure that it remains a true reflection of the will of the people.",-52.0,31.0,678.0,-3.466666666666667,-0.07669616519174041,755.0,1.1481481481481481,0.04105960264900662
Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In the realm of political advertising, few commercials have left as lasting an impact as the 1964 ""Daisy"" ad, which featured a young girl picking daisies while a menacing mushroom cloud loomed overhead. This stark imagery was strategically crafted to evoke fear and urgency, aiming to portray then-presidential candidate Barry Goldwater as a reckless warmonger. The ad was approved by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who sought to bolster his own campaign by contrasting his leadership with that of his opponent.

Johnson’s campaign was not without its own controversies, particularly regarding his policies in Vietnam. However, the Daisy ad's brilliance lay in its ability to shift the conversation away from Johnson's own shortcomings and focus public attention on the perceived dangers posed by Goldwater. The ad's emotional resonance and stark visuals became a hallmark of political advertising, illustrating how fear can be wielded as a powerful tool in electoral politics.

Fast forward to the present, and the potential for a modern reinterpretation of the Daisy ad emerges, particularly in the context of Hillary Clinton's campaign. The author suggests that a new version of the ad could effectively highlight Clinton's own failures and shortcomings, potentially reshaping the narrative surrounding her candidacy. In a political landscape where every misstep is magnified, a well-crafted ad could significantly impact her campaign by focusing on her vulnerabilities rather than her strengths.

Rumors have begun to circulate about a potential ""Daisy"" remake targeting Donald Trump, which the author interprets as a sign of desperation among Clinton's staff. This speculation underscores the high stakes of the current election cycle, where both sides are keenly aware of the power of visual media in swaying public opinion. If the Clinton campaign is indeed considering such a strategy, it speaks volumes about their concerns regarding her electability and the need to counter Trump's formidable presence.

Media coverage of political candidates has come under scrutiny, particularly in how it addresses the shifting positions of figures like Ted Cruz. The author critiques the media for its selective reporting, suggesting that critical details about Democratic candidates are often downplayed or overlooked. In contrast, derogatory stories about Democrats tend to receive less enduring coverage, which can shape public perception in subtle yet significant ways.

This selective reporting is exacerbated by the influence of short attention spans on media consumption. In an age where news is consumed in bite-sized pieces, the depth of coverage often suffers. The author argues that this phenomenon can lead to a lack of accountability for Democratic candidates, as their past comments and positions may not be scrutinized as rigorously as those of their Republican counterparts.

The article also revisits past critical remarks made by Barack Obama and Michelle Obama regarding Hillary Clinton, which raise questions about her trustworthiness and qualifications. These comments, once prominent in the political discourse, have seemingly faded from the public's memory, illustrating the transient nature of media narratives. The author posits that a new Daisy ad could serve to remind voters of these critical perspectives, creating a more comprehensive view of Clinton's candidacy.

The call for a new daisy commercial that documents Clinton's shortcomings is framed not just as a political strategy, but as a necessary step to ensure voters are fully informed. By revisiting the emotional weight and stark imagery of the original Daisy ad, a modern version could resonate with voters in a way that transcends traditional campaign messaging. It could serve as a poignant reminder of the stakes involved in the election, urging voters to consider the implications of their choices.

Ultimately, the views expressed in this discourse reflect a broader conversation about the role of media and advertising in shaping political narratives. The legacy of the original Daisy ad serves as a reminder of the power of imagery and emotion in political communication. As the 2024 election approaches, the potential for a reimagined version of this iconic advertisement underscores the ongoing relevance of fear and urgency in political messaging.

In conclusion, the author advocates for a new approach to political advertising that not only highlights the strengths of candidates but also holds them accountable for their past actions and decisions. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the lessons of the past remain pertinent, reminding us that the art of persuasion in politics is as much about the narrative we craft as it is about the candidates themselves.",-18.0,11.0,940.0,-0.5625,-0.019148936170212766,821.0,0.3793103448275862,0.013398294762484775

Fake_3-Webpage,Why is it “RACIST” to Question Someone’s Birth Certificate? – Eagle Rising,"The Democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly. If you question the veracity of a black president’s birth certificate you are racist. That is the outright claim of Lynn Sweet Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times made on Fox News. Consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist. What is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur?

First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification.

Recent discussions have resurfaced regarding the legitimacy of former President Barack Obama’s birth certificate, with allegations of intimidation tactics employed by Democrats against those questioning its validity. Lynn Sweet, the Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, has asserted that such inquiries equate to racism. However, this claim has been critiqued as a non-sequitur that dismisses what some consider legitimate concerns about the document.

Additionally, the hospital listed on the birth certificate reportedly did not exist at the time it was claimed to have issued the document.

The author of this article argues that these inconsistencies point to possible falsification, raising questions about whether any original birth certificate has ever been produced.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The article discusses a homophobic attack on Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual, in May 2016.

The violent encounter resulted in a broken jaw for Woods, marking a severe escalation in the ongoing issue of hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community.

Witnesses to the attack reported that the assailant shouted ""Muslim stuff"" during the confrontation, suggesting a troubling intertwining of homophobia and religious intolerance. This incident is not isolated; a similar attack on a gay couple occurred around the same time in Brighton, raising alarms about the safety of LGBTQ+ individuals in public spaces.

Woods' friend described him as a gentle person, emphasizing the profound impact that such violence can have on individuals who simply wish to live their lives authentically. The assailant reportedly used a knuckleduster during the attack, underscoring the premeditated nature of the violence.

Sgt. Peter Allan expressed sadness over the rise in homophobic assaults, acknowledging the pain inflicted on victims like Woods. However, he also noted that the victims are recovering and that arrests have been made, providing a glimmer of hope in the wake of such distressing events.

The article further explores the broader societal implications of these attacks, contrasting the acceptance of the gay community with certain interpretations of Islamic teachings. It highlights the fact that Shariah law condemns homosexuality, suggesting that radical Islam and the gay community cannot coexist peacefully. Woods' experience serves as a harrowing illustration of this conflict, underscoring the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in a world where such tensions persist.

As communities grapple with issues of acceptance and intolerance, the need for dialogue and understanding becomes increasingly vital. The hope is that incidents like the one involving Aaron Woods will galvanize efforts to combat hate and foster a more inclusive society for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. The fight against homophobia remains a pressing concern, and the call for unity in the face of division is louder than ever.",-26.0,-41.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,399.0,-2.5625,-0.10275689223057644
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

In a shocking incident that has sent ripples through the community of St. Cloud, Minnesota, a man wearing a security uniform launched a violent attack on shoppers at a local mall on Saturday evening. The attacker, identified as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and Muslim, reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" as he stabbed nine individuals during the rampage. Eyewitness accounts describe a scene of chaos and fear as shoppers fled for safety.

The attack began when Adan approached at least one victim and asked whether they were Muslim before proceeding to stab them. This chilling detail has raised concerns and questions about the motivations behind the attack. Members of the St. Cloud Somali-American community quickly recognized Adan as the perpetrator, leading to a wave of disbelief and sorrow among those who knew him.

In the wake of the attack, ISIS claimed responsibility, asserting that Adan was one of their own. This declaration has intensified fears about the influence of extremist ideologies within local communities. The incident follows a series of alarming events linked to terrorism across the country, including a bomb explosion at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey and attacks in New York and Chelsea, Manhattan. These incidents have heightened tensions and concerns about public safety.

St. Cloud has seen a significant influx of Somali refugees in recent years, making the city home to a diverse community. In the aftermath of the attack, Somali officials expressed support for Adan's family, describing him as a good man and an accomplished student. This sentiment reflects the deep sense of loss and confusion felt by many within the Somali-American community, who are grappling with the actions of one of their own.

As the investigation unfolds, the response from law enforcement has been swift. Officer Jason Falconer, an off-duty police officer who was present at the mall, intervened during the attack and shot Adan, ultimately killing him. The mayor of St. Cloud praised Falconer as a hero, acknowledging his decisive action that likely prevented further bloodshed.

The attack has also reignited discussions about the challenges faced by Somali-Americans, particularly in the context of their vulnerability to recruitment by terrorist organizations such as ISIS and Al-Shabaab. Reports indicate that some Somali-Americans have been involved in collaborations with Islamist terror groups, raising alarm about the potential for further radicalization within the community. Al-Shabaab, in particular, has previously threatened attacks on shopping malls, further underscoring the need for vigilance.

As the nation grapples with the implications of this incident, political discussions surrounding immigration and refugee resettlement have resurfaced. The potential for an increase in Muslim refugee resettlement under a future Hillary Clinton administration has raised concerns among some segments of the population about the risk of terrorism. Critics argue that such policies could lead to greater security threats, while supporters emphasize the humanitarian need to provide refuge to those fleeing violence and persecution.

The author expresses a strong opposition to Hillary Clinton, suggesting that her presidency could lead to an uptick in terror attacks in the United States. This perspective reflects a broader sentiment among certain voters who feel that national security should take precedence over immigration policies. The call to vote for Donald Trump has gained traction among those who believe that a tougher stance on immigration is necessary to protect American citizens.

In the aftermath of the St. Cloud mall attack, the community is left to grapple with the implications of this tragic event. The dichotomy of a community mourning the actions of one individual while simultaneously supporting his family highlights the complexities of identity and belonging in a diverse society. As investigations continue, the focus will remain on understanding the motivations behind Adan's actions and how communities can work together to prevent such incidents in the future.

The St. Cloud Somali-American community faces a challenging path ahead as they seek to heal from this traumatic event. The need for dialogue and understanding between different groups within the community has never been more critical. Building bridges and fostering relationships will be essential in addressing the fear and division that can arise in the wake of such violence.

As the nation reflects on this incident, the importance of community resilience and solidarity becomes paramount. The St. Cloud mall attack serves as a stark reminder of the challenges posed by extremism and the need for collective action to combat hatred and violence in all its forms. The community's response will play a crucial role in shaping the narrative moving forward and ensuring that such tragedies do not define their identity.

In conclusion, the St. Cloud mall attack has brought to light the complexities of living in a multicultural society. As the community navigates the aftermath of this incident, the focus must remain on healing, understanding, and preventing future acts of violence. The actions of one individual should not overshadow the contributions and positive impact of the many who call St. Cloud home. It is through unity and resilience that communities can rise above the challenges they face and work towards a safer, more inclusive future for all.",-72.0,-51.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,942.0,-1.0625,-0.054140127388535034
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

In recent years, millennials have been characterized as the ""everyone gets a trophy generation,"" a label that reflects a broader societal shift toward declining standards for effort and an increasing emphasis on victimhood. This narrative has taken on a particularly stark dimension in the case of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the New Jersey and New York City bombings, who previously positioned himself as a victim of ""Islamophobia.""

Rahami's claims of victimhood are underscored by a lawsuit he and his father filed against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police in 2011. The suit alleged discrimination against their family-owned restaurant, First American Fried Chicken, asserting that they faced police harassment and ""selective enforcement"" based on their Muslim identity. The Rahami family contended that local residents subjected them to racial abuse, with statements such as, ""Muslims don’t belong here,"" highlighting the challenges they faced in their community.

Despite these claims, Mayor Christian Bollwage of Elizabeth denied any allegations of discrimination, asserting that complaints against the Rahami family were rooted in issues of noise and gatherings rather than ethnicity or religion. This divergence in perspectives raises questions about the complexities of victim narratives in contemporary society, particularly in light of Rahami's subsequent actions.

The lawsuit filed by the Rahami family was not just a legal maneuver but a manifestation of Ahmad Rahami's ongoing grievances with local officials and police. The narrative he constructed around his experiences suggests a deep-seated belief in systemic victimization, which stands in stark contrast to his later actions as a perpetrator of terrorism. The contradictions inherent in Rahami's story invite a broader examination of societal perceptions of victimhood and the implications for understanding terrorism.

The juxtaposition of Rahami's claims and his violent actions serves as a critical commentary on the evolving definitions of victimhood in today's world. It raises uncomfortable questions about the legitimacy of victim narratives and the potential for individuals to exploit these narratives for personal gain or justification of harmful behavior. As society grapples with the complexities of identity, discrimination, and violence, the case of Ahmad Khan Rahami exemplifies the troubling intersections of these issues.

In a climate where victimhood can sometimes overshadow accountability, it is essential to scrutinize the narratives that emerge from such situations. Rahami’s story is not just about one man's grievances; it is indicative of a broader cultural phenomenon that blurs the lines between victim and aggressor. As discussions around these themes continue, the need for clarity and critical thought becomes increasingly vital in understanding the motivations behind acts of violence and the societal frameworks that may enable them. 

Ultimately, the Rahami case challenges us to reconsider our perceptions of victimhood and the responsibilities that accompany it, urging a more nuanced dialogue about identity, discrimination, and the consequences of our narratives.",-38.0,-46.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,537.0,-2.7058823529411766,-0.0856610800744879
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- Employers have historically threatened to relocate businesses to influence voting outcomes.

In a climate where political outcomes can significantly impact the workforce, employers have historically wielded the threat of relocation as a means to sway voting decisions. This tactic, aimed at influencing the political landscape, often results in adverse consequences for employees. Workers who align their votes with employer interests frequently face repercussions, including outsourcing and stagnant wages, raising concerns about the integrity of democratic processes within the workplace.

One prominent figure in this debate is Andy Puzder, the CEO of fast food giants Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Puzder has been vocal about his intentions regarding economic actions contingent upon election results, making explicit threats that underscore the power dynamics between employers and employees. His recent statements have sparked discussions about the future of labor in the fast food industry, particularly in light of his plans for automation.

Puzder has publicly declared that should a Democrat win the upcoming election, he intends to fully automate his restaurants. He cites rising labor costs as the driving force behind this decision, suggesting that automation is not just a preference but a necessity for maintaining profitability. This move aligns with a growing trend in the fast food sector, where companies are increasingly turning to technology to reduce labor expenses.

The vision Puzder has for his restaurants includes an automated fast food system akin to Eatsa, a restaurant model where customers place orders via kiosks, eliminating the need for human interaction. This shift towards automation raises significant questions about the future of jobs in the industry, as Puzder’s plans could potentially displace thousands of workers who rely on these positions for their livelihoods.

In his efforts to influence his employees, Puzder has taken a stance against minimum wage increases, arguing that such measures could lead to job losses rather than the intended benefits for workers. His rhetoric appears designed to persuade not only his 20,000 employees but also other fast food workers to vote against policies that would ultimately support their economic interests. This approach highlights a troubling aspect of employer-employee relations, where the threat of automation and job loss is used as leverage in the political arena.

Puzder has also maintained a blog where he discusses his views on politics and capitalism, further amplifying his perspective on these issues. However, his financial success—reportedly earning nearly $4.5 million in 2012—stands in stark contrast to the economic realities faced by his employees. While Puzder enjoys substantial profits, many of his workers struggle to make ends meet, raising questions about the alignment of his interests with those of the people he employs.

The commitment to automation that Puzder has expressed is likely to persist regardless of the election outcome. His prioritization of profits over employee welfare suggests a broader trend within the fast food industry, where the drive for efficiency and cost-cutting often overshadows the needs and rights of workers. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of such automation on employment could be profound.

The intersection of employer influence in voting and the threat of automation presents a complex challenge for workers in the fast food sector. As companies like Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s explore technological advancements to streamline operations, employees may find themselves navigating a precarious balance between job security and the economic interests of their employers. The potential for job displacement looms large, raising critical questions about the future of work in an increasingly automated world.

In conclusion, the tactics employed by employers like Puzder serve as a reminder of the delicate relationship between politics, economics, and labor. As workers face the dual pressures of political influence and the threat of automation, the need for solidarity and advocacy for fair labor practices becomes more pressing than ever. The outcome of upcoming elections may shape not only the political landscape but also the very nature of work in the fast food industry, with lasting implications for employees and their livelihoods.",21.0,10.0,642.0,0.8076923076923077,0.03271028037383177,728.0,0.38461538461538464,0.013736263736263736
Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

In a significant development that has reignited the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's private email server, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently investigating new evidence that emerged during the investigation into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton's aide, Huma Abedin. This new evidence could have far-reaching implications for both Clinton and Abedin, as it may contain tens of thousands of emails that were forwarded from Clinton's account.

The investigation into Weiner, who has faced legal troubles of his own, has taken a surprising turn as it appears that a laptop he shared may hold critical information regarding Clinton's email practices. Reports indicate that this laptop could potentially contain a trove of emails from Abedin, including those that were forwarded from Clinton’s private email account. The recovery of these emails, particularly if they are found to be work-related or classified, could suggest that both Clinton and Abedin misled the FBI during previous inquiries—a serious allegation that could warrant prosecution.

The timing of the FBI’s announcement regarding this new evidence is particularly noteworthy, as it was released just 11 days before the presidential election. This has led to speculation about the seriousness of the findings and their potential impact on the electoral landscape. The FBI’s previous investigation into Clinton, which was led by Director James Comey, concluded on July 5, 2016, when Comey outlined the evidence against Clinton but ultimately decided not to recommend charges. This decision was met with significant discontent among FBI officials, who felt that the matter warranted a more severe response.

A high-ranking FBI official disclosed that there was a prevailing consensus within the bureau that Clinton should not only lose her security clearance but also face prosecution. Such sentiments reflect the frustrations of many within the agency regarding the handling of the investigation and the perceived leniency shown towards Clinton.

Further complicating matters, an FBI summary has surfaced, revealing that a State Department official allegedly pressured the FBI concerning the declassification of information related to Clinton's emails. This summary also mentions a group of State Department officials colloquially referred to as “The Shadow Government,” who were reportedly involved in discussions about Freedom of Information requests related to Clinton's email practices. The existence of such a group raises questions about the transparency and integrity of the processes surrounding the handling of Clinton's emails.

Adding to the controversy, Wikileaks recently released emails that indicate Clinton communicated with President Obama using her private email server. This revelation contradicts earlier claims made by both Clinton and her representatives, suggesting that they misled the FBI and the public about the extent of Clinton's email usage and communications.

In the course of the investigation, it has come to light that Paul Combetta, an IT specialist who worked on Clinton's server, deleted over 33,000 emails from the account. Notably, Combetta was granted immunity during the investigation, which has raised eyebrows among critics who argue that such immunity may have shielded him from accountability. Leaked emails further indicate that Clinton was personally involved in the deletion of emails and managed her communications without any oversight, an act that could be interpreted as an attempt to conceal information.

Comey's decision not to pursue charges against Clinton was primarily based on a lack of intent to mishandle classified information. However, the emergence of new evidence suggesting willful deletion of emails could alter the narrative and lead to a reevaluation of the case. If it is determined that Clinton and Abedin acted with intent to mislead investigators, the legal ramifications could be severe.

The timeline of events leading up to the current investigation is crucial for understanding the broader context of this ongoing controversy. The story began to gain traction in March 2015, when the New York Times broke the news of Clinton's private email usage during her tenure as Secretary of State. This revelation sparked a series of developments that ultimately culminated in the FBI investigation.

As the investigation continues, the implications of the new evidence discovered during the Weiner inquiry remain to be seen. The potential for prosecution looms over both Clinton and Abedin, raising questions about accountability and the integrity of public officials. With the election approaching and public interest at an all-time high, the FBI's findings could have a profound impact on the political landscape and the future of both Clinton and Abedin.

The ramifications of this investigation extend beyond the individuals involved; they touch upon broader issues of transparency, accountability, and the public's right to know. As more information comes to light, the public will be watching closely to see how this chapter of the Clinton email saga unfolds. The stakes are high, and the implications of the FBI's findings could resonate well into the future, shaping the narrative of political accountability in America.",-6.0,-13.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,902.0,-0.41935483870967744,-0.014412416851441241
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

In a significant shift in rhetoric, Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, has openly acknowledged the shortcomings of her open borders policy for Syrian refugees, which she championed during the height of the migrant crisis. This policy, initially aimed at providing sanctuary to those fleeing conflict, has been met with severe backlash as it coincided with a notable rise in crime across German cities, including thousands of reported sexual assaults and violent incidents.

The consequences of this policy were felt acutely in the political arena, leading to a major electoral defeat for Merkel's conservative party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The German public's discontent with the handling of the migrant situation has prompted a reevaluation of the government's approach to immigration.

At her party's annual conference, Merkel candidly expressed her regrets, stating that the migrant crisis could have been managed more effectively and describing the concept of multiculturalism as a ""living lie."" This acknowledgment marks a significant departure from her previous stance, as she emphasized the need for Germany to regain control over its migration policies.

Merkel highlighted the importance of reducing the number of incoming refugees, yet she refrained from specifying a concrete limit on arrivals. Instead, she underscored her commitment to regulating and limiting migration not only at the national level but also across Europe and globally. This nuanced approach aims to balance humanitarian commitments with the pressing concerns of public safety and social cohesion.

The developments in Germany serve as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding immigration policies. As Merkel navigates the fallout from her previous decisions, observers warn that the challenges faced by Germany could offer a cautionary tale for the United States. The rising tensions surrounding immigration in both nations underscore the delicate balance required to address humanitarian needs while ensuring the safety and security of citizens.

In conclusion, Merkel's recent admissions reflect a significant turning point in her administration's stance on immigration, as the country grapples with the repercussions of its policies and the broader implications for global migration trends.",-2.0,-11.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,392.0,-0.8461538461538461,-0.02806122448979592
Fake_36-Webpage,"DISGUSTING! Because Of Hillary & Obama, NY Terrorist Will Get Better Treatment Than US Vets! ⋆ Freedom Daily","8.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two.",http://freedomdaily.com/disgusting-because-of-hillary-obama-ny-terrorist-will-get-better-treatment-than-us-vets/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3895D4C900000578-3798726-Ahmad_Khan_Rahami_28_was_taken_into_custody_on_Monday_after_a_sh-a-65_1474398076306.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

- There is a provocative statement about the moral dilemma faced by doctors treating the terrorist.","**Outrage Over Disparity in Medical Care for Terrorist and U.S. Veterans**

A stark contrast in the treatment of a terrorist responsible for bombings in New Jersey and New York City compared to U.S. veterans has sparked outrage among citizens and political figures alike. The individual in question is set to receive superior medical care, igniting a national conversation about the priorities of the healthcare system and the treatment of those who have served the nation.

During a recent campaign speech, former President Donald Trump criticized this disparity, underscoring the fact that the terrorist will have access to top doctors and modern hospital facilities, as well as legal representation. Trump's remarks highlight a growing frustration among many Americans who feel that the healthcare system is failing those who have sacrificed for their country.

This situation is particularly poignant in light of the 2014 scandal at the Veteran’s Administration (VA), which revealed long waiting lists and cover-ups of inefficiency that plagued the system. Since then, the plight of veterans seeking care has only worsened. Reports indicate that over 300,000 veterans have died while waiting for treatment, and many others have tragically taken their own lives in despair over the lack of timely medical assistance.

The author expresses deep frustration over the government's apparent prioritization of care for a terrorist over the brave men and women who have served in the armed forces. This sentiment resonates with many who believe that veterans deserve the highest level of care and support, especially given their sacrifices for the country.

Moreover, the situation raises a provocative moral dilemma for the medical professionals tasked with treating the terrorist. They find themselves in a position where they must provide care to someone who has committed heinous acts, while many veterans, who have fought to protect the nation, struggle to access the services they need. This contradiction poses ethical questions about the responsibilities of healthcare providers and the societal values that dictate who receives care and under what circumstances.

As the debate continues, it is clear that the disparity in treatment for the terrorist and U.S. veterans is a pressing issue that demands attention. The healthcare system's priorities are under scrutiny, and many are calling for reforms to ensure that those who have defended the nation receive the care they rightfully deserve. The juxtaposition of the treatment of terrorists versus veterans serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing challenges facing the nation's healthcare system and the urgent need for change.",13.0,-10.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,453.0,-0.6666666666666666,-0.02207505518763797

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",http://freedomdaily.com/despicable-hillary-wants-put-hero-cop-stopped-mall-terror-attack-business/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-vs-cop.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

In a dramatic turn of events in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Jason Falconer, an NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, acted swiftly to neutralize a threat when an ISIS terrorist launched a violent attack, stabbing eight individuals. Falconer's decisive intervention is being hailed as an act of bravery that potentially saved countless lives during the harrowing incident.

Falconer, who has dedicated his life to the protection of citizens, initially served as a law enforcement officer before founding his firearms training company, Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business focuses on providing training for law-abiding citizens who wish to carry concealed firearms for self-defense. This mission aligns with the principles of the Second Amendment, which Falconer staunchly supports.

However, Falconer now finds himself at the center of a political storm, as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has expressed intentions to target his business if elected president. Clinton's stance appears to be rooted in her broader opposition to firearms-related businesses and the Second Amendment itself. Her campaign rhetoric suggests a commitment to implementing policies that could significantly impact the operations of companies like Falconer’s, aiming to put them out of business.

One of the key legislative protections that Falconer’s business currently enjoys is the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). This act shields firearms manufacturers and dealers from frivolous lawsuits, allowing them to operate without the constant threat of legal action stemming from the misuse of firearms. Clinton has openly called for the repeal of this crucial protection, raising concerns among those in the firearms community about the implications for businesses like Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc.

In her criticisms, Clinton has been accused of misrepresenting the nature of the PLCAA, claiming it provides “immunity” to gunmakers and dealers. This assertion has sparked debate among supporters of the Second Amendment, who argue that the act is designed to prevent unjust legal actions rather than grant immunity. Falconer and his supporters contend that repealing the PLCAA would not only endanger their livelihoods but also undermine the rights of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves.

Falconer’s actions during the St. Cloud attack have brought renewed attention to the importance of firearms training and self-defense. His commitment to educating citizens on responsible firearm use has been a cornerstone of his professional life. As a skilled instructor, he emphasizes the significance of preparedness and the right to self-defense in a world where threats can emerge unexpectedly.

The political implications of Falconer’s heroism are significant. As the election approaches, voters are being encouraged to consider the impact of their choices on individuals like Falconer, who have dedicated their lives to protecting communities. The narrative surrounding Falconer’s actions and Clinton’s proposed policies highlights a stark contrast in perspectives on firearms and personal safety.

In light of these events, the call to action for voters is clear: supporting candidates who uphold the rights of citizens and the Second Amendment is crucial for ensuring that individuals like Jason Falconer can continue their vital work in firearms training and self-defense. As the political landscape evolves, the outcomes of these discussions will undoubtedly shape the future of firearms training and the rights of law-abiding citizens across the nation.",-11.0,25.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,613.0,1.0416666666666667,0.040783034257748776
Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

As the presidential election heats up, the health of candidate Hillary Clinton has emerged as a focal point of concern among voters and political analysts alike. Recent polling data reveals a significant shift in public perception regarding her health, with over 40% of registered voters now rating her condition as ""below average"" or ""very poor."" This marks a notable increase from just 26% in late August, highlighting the growing anxiety surrounding her fitness for office.

In contrast to the rising concerns about Clinton's health, Donald Trump appears to be enjoying a more favorable assessment from voters. Approximately 36% of respondents rate Trump’s health as ""above average"" or ""excellent,"" suggesting a stark divergence in public sentiment between the two candidates.

Clinton, who is 68 years old, is often perceived as looking older than her age, which has fueled speculation regarding her overall well-being. Nearly 80% of those surveyed are aware of her potential medical issues, indicating that concerns about her health are widespread among the electorate. These worries have been exacerbated by reports that Clinton is taking Coumadin, a medication commonly prescribed to prevent blood clots, leading to speculation that she may have experienced a stroke. 

Further complicating the narrative around her health, Clinton's executive staff has reportedly conducted research into Provigil, a drug often prescribed for serious conditions such as narcolepsy. This investigation has raised additional questions about the candidate's health status and her ability to perform the demanding duties of the presidency.

Adding to the concerns, Clinton's assistant, Huma Abedin, has been quoted discussing instances of Clinton experiencing confusion and requiring naps during the day. Such revelations contribute to the perception that Clinton may be struggling with her health, which could impact her campaign.

Public appearances have not helped to quell the rising anxiety regarding Clinton's health. Various videos and images have surfaced showing her appearing unsteady, suffering from coughing fits, and requiring assistance while navigating stairs. These moments have been captured by the media and shared widely, further fueling speculation about her physical condition.

There are also allegations that efforts have been made to suppress videos of Clinton fainting at the 9/11 Memorial, which, if true, would indicate a concerted attempt to manage the narrative surrounding her health. Observers have noted that Clinton’s public events are not heavily promoted, a strategy that some believe is aimed at minimizing voter exposure to her in-person appearances, which could raise further questions about her vitality.

One of the most notable aspects of Clinton's public speaking engagements has been her frequent coughing episodes, which have become a point of contention among voters. The persistent nature of these coughs has raised alarms about her health, leading many to question whether she is fit to be the leader of the nation.

As the election progresses, the implications of Clinton's health perceptions could have significant ramifications for her campaign. With the electorate increasingly concerned about her well-being, Clinton may face challenges in convincing voters of her capability to serve as president. The rising skepticism surrounding her health could overshadow her political platform and achievements, making it essential for her campaign to address these concerns head-on.

In a landscape where health is becoming an increasingly critical issue for voters, Clinton's team will need to navigate the complexities of public perception while focusing on her policy proposals and vision for the future. The ability to reassure the electorate about her health could prove to be a pivotal factor in the upcoming election.

As the race continues, both candidates will be under scrutiny, but for Clinton, the stakes are particularly high. With health concerns taking center stage, the former Secretary of State must not only combat the narrative around her physical condition but also work to maintain the focus on her qualifications and readiness to lead the nation. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining how these health perceptions will influence voter sentiment and ultimately the outcome of the election.",-11.0,13.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,752.0,0.48148148148148145,0.017287234042553192

Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

In a provocative new release, Dolly Kyle has unveiled a tell-all book titled ""Hillary: The Other Woman,"" which makes startling allegations about the former president and first lady, Bill and Hillary Clinton. The book delves into the couple's political behavior and personal interactions, presenting a controversial perspective on their lives and careers.

Kyle's narrative includes claims that the Clintons used racial epithets, a charge that could have significant implications for their public image. Additionally, the book recounts a troubling incident during an Easter egg hunt where Hillary Clinton reportedly expressed frustration towards developmentally challenged children, raising questions about her empathy and approach to those with disabilities.

The book also paints a picture of Hillary Clinton's attitude towards the people of Arkansas, describing her as condescending and viewing them as ""ignorant hillbillies."" This characterization suggests a disconnect between the Clintons and the constituents they served, particularly during Bill Clinton's tenure as governor of Arkansas for eight years.

Hillary's background is also explored in the book, revealing that she was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois. This upbringing appears to have shaped her views, as she is depicted as considering herself superior to southerners, except when she was campaigning in New York, where she sought to connect with voters.

Bill Clinton's political journey is highlighted, noting his decision not to run for reelection in 1990 as governor, opting instead to focus on his presidential ambitions. This strategic choice marked a pivotal moment in his career, ultimately leading to his election as the 42nd President of the United States.

Kyle's book promises to ignite discussions and debates surrounding the Clintons, offering a controversial lens through which to view their political legacy and personal lives. As the narrative unfolds, readers are left to ponder the implications of these revelations on the couple's enduring influence in American politics.",-10.0,-5.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,361.0,-0.4166666666666667,-0.013850415512465374

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a groundbreaking decision, a Massachusetts judge has ruled in favor of a special law that permits black males to flee from law enforcement if they feel they are being ""disproportionately"" targeted. This ruling, handed down by the Supreme Court, is significant in that it cannot be appealed, setting a precedent that has sparked a wave of discussion and concern within the community.

The decision raises pressing questions about public safety and the implications for police work in the state. Critics of the ruling argue that it could potentially increase the danger to citizens, as it may embolden individuals to evade law enforcement under circumstances that could escalate into chaotic situations. The difficult and dangerous nature of police work is underscored in light of this ruling, as officers may now face additional challenges in their efforts to maintain order and ensure public safety.

One of the most contentious aspects of the ruling is its stipulation that the act of running cannot be used by police as ""reasonable suspicion"" for detaining individuals. This move has drawn sharp criticism from various quarters, with many expressing skepticism about the law's effectiveness in promoting safety. The fear is that this legal framework may inadvertently create an environment where evasion is normalized, complicating the already challenging interactions between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

The implications of this ruling extend beyond the immediate effects on policing; they touch on broader societal issues regarding race, justice, and community relations. While the intention behind the law may be to address perceived injustices, the potential for unintended consequences looms large. As police officers navigate their duties in an increasingly complex landscape, the concern remains that this ruling could lead to heightened tensions between law enforcement and the very communities they are tasked with protecting.

In conclusion, the Massachusetts Supreme Court's decision to allow black males to run from police if they feel disproportionately targeted presents a controversial shift in the legal landscape. While the law aims to address concerns of racial profiling, the ramifications for public safety and police-community relations are significant. As the debate continues, the author offers a sardonic observation: one can only hope that law-abiding citizens will not feel the need to run from police, as the ruling seems to suggest a troubling new reality in the ongoing discourse surrounding race and law enforcement.",-13.0,7.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,445.0,0.5,0.015730337078651686
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a candid admission, German Chancellor Angela Merkel revealed that she would alter her open migrant policy if given the chance to turn back time. This statement comes in the wake of recent electoral defeats that have prompted her to reconsider her approach to migration and refugee issues in Germany.

Merkel, who has long been a proponent of welcoming refugees, particularly during the 2015 crisis, acknowledged that the country was not adequately prepared for the influx of migrants at that time. Her recognition of this shortcoming marks a significant moment in her leadership, especially as the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) faces mounting pressure following disappointing electoral results in Berlin.

The election outcomes have underscored a growing anti-migrant sentiment among the German populace, a trend that has been capitalized on by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Merkel took responsibility for the CDU's lackluster performance, indicating that her policies may have contributed to the party's struggles in appealing to voters.

Despite her regrets about the past, Merkel remains steadfast in her refusal to implement substantial changes to her migration policies. She has dismissed proposals from the Christian Social Union (CSU) regarding the introduction of a cap on migrant numbers and the prioritization of Christian migrants over their Muslim counterparts. Merkel emphasized that such measures would contradict the core principles of the CDU, which is founded on values of inclusivity and equality.

The tension between Merkel and the CSU has been palpable, particularly with CSU leader Horst Seehofer threatening to withdraw support for her during the 2017 campaign over the contentious issue of migrant caps. This ongoing friction highlights the challenges Merkel faces within her own party as she navigates the complex landscape of German politics.

The increasing anti-migrant sentiment in Germany has been linked to various societal concerns, including terrorism, migrant crime, and broader issues of violent crime. These fears have fueled a narrative that has resonated with many voters, leading to a shift in political allegiances and a rise in support for parties like the AfD.

Looking ahead, Merkel faces significant challenges as she prepares for the next federal election. The growing discontent among the electorate regarding her handling of migration could pose a serious threat to her party's prospects. As the political climate continues to evolve, Merkel’s ability to address these concerns while maintaining her principles will be crucial in determining the future of her leadership and the CDU's standing in German politics.

In summary, Merkel's reflections on her migrant policy reveal a leader grappling with the consequences of her decisions amid a shifting political landscape. While she acknowledges the need for better preparation and the impact of her policies on recent election results, her commitment to the principles of inclusivity and equality remains unwavering. As Germany moves forward, the interplay between public sentiment and political strategy will undoubtedly shape the nation's approach to migration in the years to come.",-14.0,3.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,546.0,0.15789473684210525,0.005494505494505495
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

In Sundsvall, Sweden, a troubling case involving Abdullah, a Somali asylum seeker, has drawn attention to issues of domestic violence and the complexities surrounding cultural practices. Abdullah, who has a history of violent crimes, including multiple convictions for assaults and molestations, has been living off welfare benefits since his arrival in Sweden five years ago.

The latest incident of violence occurred when Abdullah returned home to find his pregnant wife still babysitting her niece, despite having demanded the child leave before he returned from a night out. This led to a brutal confrontation, where Abdullah physically assaulted his wife, kicking her in the head and stomach. The assault was not only physical; it extended to psychological humiliation as well, with Abdullah pouring beer over her and urinating on her.

This incident raises significant concerns about the treatment of women in domestic settings and the societal implications of such behavior. Critics have pointed out that Abdullah's actions reflect a troubling interpretation of cultural and religious texts. Specifically, the case references Quran 4:34, which discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. This verse has been cited by some as a potential justification for abusive behavior, highlighting a selective adherence to religious teachings that can lead to violence.

The author of the article emphasizes the dangers of interpreting religious texts in ways that condone violence, particularly against women. Abdullah's actions are seen as a distortion of Islamic teachings, as they ignore the broader principles of compassion and respect that are foundational to many interpretations of the faith. This selective adherence not only perpetuates cycles of violence but also undermines the rights of women within both cultural and legal frameworks.

As Sweden grapples with issues surrounding immigration and integration, cases like Abdullah's present challenges for the legal system and social services. The fact that he has been able to live off welfare benefits while committing violent crimes raises questions about accountability and the effectiveness of support systems in place for asylum seekers.

The case has sparked discussions about the need for better education and resources for immigrants, particularly regarding domestic violence and gender equality. Advocates argue that addressing these issues is crucial for fostering a safe and inclusive society where all individuals can thrive free from violence and discrimination.

The incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by many women in abusive relationships, regardless of their cultural background. It underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing domestic violence as a societal issue that transcends cultural and religious boundaries.

As the legal proceedings against Abdullah unfold, the case will likely continue to provoke debate about the intersection of culture, religion, and the law in Sweden. The hope is that it will lead to greater awareness and action against domestic violence, ensuring that such incidents are met with appropriate legal consequences and support for victims.",-28.0,-37.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,536.0,-1.85,-0.06902985074626866
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has sparked significant controversy, Pennsylvania Republicans are advancing House Bill 29, legislation that would enable voter intimidation on Election Day. If passed, the bill would allow outsiders to monitor polling locations in non-residential districts and challenge the eligibility of voters, a provision critics warn could disrupt the electoral process.

The proposed bill has drawn sharp criticism from various advocacy groups and legal experts who argue that it essentially legalizes voter intimidation. Opponents fear that the ability to challenge voters could lead to discriminatory practices based on race or religion. Adam Gitlin, a representative from the Brennan Center for Justice, has voiced concerns that the bill could exacerbate existing barriers to voting, creating longer lines at polling places and discouraging participation among voters who may feel threatened.

Former President Donald Trump has played a role in amplifying the rhetoric surrounding the bill, encouraging his supporters to monitor polling areas. Trump has repeatedly claimed that election rigging poses a significant threat to democracy, a narrative that has resonated with a segment of the Republican base. This context adds another layer of complexity to the motivations behind the bill, as many see it as a tactic to favor Trump in what is expected to be a closely contested election.

In a strategic move, an amendment to House Bill 29 has been proposed that would make the legislation effective immediately upon its passage, rather than implementing a 60-day waiting period. This urgency reflects the Republican Party's desire to establish the framework for monitoring polling places ahead of the upcoming elections, raising alarms among those who view the bill as an attack on the integrity of the voting process.

The implications of House Bill 29 extend beyond Pennsylvania, as its passage could set a precedent for similar voter intimidation tactics in other states. Critics warn that if these practices are successful in Pennsylvania, they could embolden other Republican-led states to adopt similar measures, further undermining the democratic process across the nation.

The potential consequences of the bill are significant, with many fearing that it could lead to an environment of fear and uncertainty at polling places. Voters may feel less inclined to cast their ballots if they believe they will be subjected to challenges or intimidation from partisan monitors. Gitlin's warnings about longer lines and reduced voter participation highlight the real-world impact such legislation could have on the electoral landscape.

As the debate surrounding House Bill 29 continues, advocates for voting rights are mobilizing to oppose the legislation. They argue that the right to vote should be protected and that any measures that threaten this fundamental democratic principle must be challenged. The upcoming discussions in the Pennsylvania legislature will be closely watched, not only for their immediate implications but also for the broader impact on voter rights across the country.

In conclusion, House Bill 29 represents a contentious chapter in the ongoing struggle over voting rights in the United States. As Pennsylvania Republicans push for its passage, the potential for voter intimidation looms large, raising critical questions about the future of fair and equitable elections in the state and beyond.",-19.0,-26.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,581.0,-1.3,-0.04475043029259897

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, an American Olympian fencer renowned for being the first to compete in the Olympics while wearing a hijab, recently shared her experiences regarding the challenges she faces as a Muslim athlete in the United States. Muhammad expressed feelings of insecurity, revealing that she has been followed home from practice in New York City, highlighting the everyday struggles that come with her identity.

In her remarks, Muhammad underscored the severity of racist incidents she encounters. However, she also noted that these experiences, while distressing, pale in comparison to more extreme acts of violence, such as the tragic shooting incident in North Carolina. This comparison sheds light on the broader context of racial and religious tensions in America, where hate crimes can manifest in various forms.

The article further delves into the complexities of hate crimes, suggesting that while Muhammad has faced discrimination, hate crimes against Jewish individuals are reported to be more prevalent than those targeting Muslims. This observation raises questions about the nature of societal challenges faced by different communities and the visibility of their struggles.

In a provocative turn, the article questions why Muhammad does not consider moving to a Muslim-majority country, implying that conditions for Muslims may be better in America than elsewhere. This statement invites a deeper examination of the safety and freedoms available to individuals in the U.S. compared to potential dangers they might face in other regions.

Ultimately, the discussion highlights the contrasting experiences of Muslims in America, where they can enjoy certain liberties and opportunities, against the backdrop of ongoing challenges related to racism and safety. Muhammad's experiences serve as a reminder of the complexities of identity, belonging, and the fight against discrimination in contemporary society. Her story resonates as a call for awareness and understanding of the diverse experiences within the fabric of American life.",-23.0,-25.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,351.0,-2.0833333333333335,-0.07122507122507123
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

The city of Charlotte has found itself in turmoil as protests escalated into riots following a shooting incident involving a black police officer and a black suspect. What began as a peaceful demonstration quickly spiraled into chaos, raising questions about the intentions and actions of those involved.

As the unrest unfolded, it became increasingly difficult to ignore the behavior of the protesters. Many took to the streets, not in a spirit of unity or constructive dialogue, but rather in a manner that can only be described as reckless and irresponsible. The author of this piece expresses a deep frustration with the transformation of a peaceful gathering into a scene of pandemonium, where the original message was lost amid the noise and violence.

One particularly troubling incident highlighted the troubling atmosphere of the protests: rioters were seen laughing at an injured police officer while waiting for backup to arrive. This moment encapsulates the disconnection between the stated goals of the movement and the actions taken by some of its supporters. Instead of standing in solidarity with those who uphold the law, these individuals chose to mock a situation that could have had dire consequences, showcasing a troubling lack of empathy and respect.

The author further critiques the Black Lives Matter movement, arguing that its actions often contradict its professed mission. If the movement truly championed the value of black lives, one might expect to see a greater emphasis on reducing violence within the black community, especially during times of protest. Instead, the narrative seems to focus on external grievances while ignoring the internal issues that contribute to violence. This contradiction raises significant concerns about the movement's true priorities.

Moreover, the author generalizes the traits of those who identify with the Black Lives Matter movement, labeling them as violent and irresponsible. This sweeping characterization does a disservice to the many individuals who genuinely seek reform and justice. However, the actions of a vocal minority during these protests cannot be overlooked. The behavior displayed during the riots has led to a growing perception that the movement is more about chaos than constructive change.

In addition to the critique of the protesters, there is a strong condemnation of what the author perceives as racism against white individuals perpetuated by some supporters of Black Lives Matter. This sentiment echoes a growing frustration among those who feel that discussions around race have become increasingly divisive rather than unifying. The author emphasizes the importance of judging individuals based on their actions rather than the color of their skin, advocating for a more nuanced understanding of accountability that transcends racial lines.

The situation in Charlotte serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding race relations and social justice movements in America today. While the desire for change is a noble pursuit, the methods employed by some can lead to further division and misunderstanding. The author’s disdain for the Black Lives Matter movement stems from a belief that the movement has strayed from its original intent, focusing instead on creating chaos rather than fostering dialogue and understanding.

In conclusion, the riots in Charlotte stand as a cautionary tale about the potential for peaceful protests to devolve into violence and chaos. The actions of those who participated in the riots have not only overshadowed the original message but have also raised critical questions about the accountability of individuals within the movement. As society grapples with issues of race, justice, and community, it is imperative that all voices are heard and that actions align with the ideals of the movement. Only then can there be hope for genuine progress and understanding.",-83.0,-48.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,668.0,-1.8461538461538463,-0.0718562874251497
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In his final address at the United Nations General Assembly, President Obama stood firm in his progressive beliefs, which have often drawn sharp criticism from various political factions. Characterized by many as a far-left, borderline socialist progressive liberal, Obama has faced backlash for policies like the Affordable Care Act, gun control measures, and an increasing acceptance of refugees. 

During the speech, Obama advocated for a framework of international governance and law, suggesting that in the pursuit of global security, the United States may need to sacrifice certain freedoms. This proposition has raised eyebrows among critics who argue that such sacrifices could undermine the very foundations of American liberty. However, Obama was clear that the right to self-defense should remain sacrosanct, emphasizing that this freedom should never be compromised.

Despite acknowledging the criticism he has received from Americans regarding his views, Obama maintained his stance, reflecting a belief that his policies are essential for a more secure world. This unwavering position has sparked frustration among those who perceive his approach as arrogant and inflexible, particularly in a political climate that is increasingly polarized.

The divisiveness in Washington D.C. has become a focal point of concern, with many questioning the accountability of leadership in bridging the growing chasm between differing ideologies. Critics argue that Obama's unwillingness to compromise has contributed to the current state of turmoil, leaving many Americans feeling unheard and disenfranchised.

As Obama steps away from the presidency, his final speech serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring debates surrounding governance, freedom, and security. While he advocates for a collective approach to global challenges, the reactions to his policies and philosophy underscore a deeply divided nation, grappling with the implications of leadership decisions that resonate far beyond the halls of power.",13.0,7.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,343.0,0.6363636363636364,0.02040816326530612
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the world of professional sports, few narratives are as starkly contrasting as those of Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick. Both former NFL quarterbacks, they now find themselves in the shadows of starting positions, yet their reputations and public perceptions could not be more different.

Tim Tebow has long been respected for his character and integrity. Known for his strong Christian faith and philanthropic efforts, he has cultivated an image that resonates positively with many fans. In contrast, Colin Kaepernick has faced significant backlash for his controversial National Anthem protest, which he initiated to highlight social justice issues. This protest has led to a polarized view of Kaepernick, with many critics labeling him as a divisive figure who has tarnished his legacy.

When asked about Kaepernick’s protest, Tebow offered a succinct response, emphasizing the importance of standing for one’s beliefs ""the right way."" This statement underscores Tebow's commitment to expressing his convictions while maintaining respect for the traditions of the sport. His approach has helped him avoid the negative press that has often surrounded Kaepernick.

The author of this article takes a firm stance against Kaepernick's actions, criticizing him for being a high-paid bench player rather than a starting quarterback. The suggestion is made that if Kaepernick feels so strongly about social issues, he should choose to protest on his own time, rather than during a nationally televised event. This perspective reflects a broader sentiment that professional athletes should prioritize their responsibilities on the field over political statements.

Further, the author asserts that claims of oppression in the U.S. are unfounded, equating such claims with laziness. This viewpoint is illustrated by citing President Obama as an example of an individual who overcame significant challenges without resorting to claims of oppression. The implication is clear: success is achievable through hard work and determination, rather than through public protests.

The article also touches upon the topic of affirmative action, suggesting that such policies can negatively impact job opportunities for others. This argument reinforces the idea that merit and hard work should be the primary criteria for success, rather than considerations based on race or background.

In contrast to Kaepernick’s controversial stance, Tebow is portrayed as wise for steering clear of negative press and focusing on his career aspirations, particularly his hopes of securing a spot on the New York Mets roster. His commitment to personal and professional growth stands in stark contrast to Kaepernick’s tumultuous journey.

As the debate over athlete activism continues, the contrasting paths of Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick serve as a reminder of the complexities of public perception in the world of sports. While Tebow remains a figure of respect and integrity, Kaepernick's legacy is marred by controversy and division.",-6.0,7.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,521.0,0.3333333333333333,0.013435700575815739
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

As discussions surrounding immigration reform continue, the border wall has emerged as a pivotal national security measure, extending beyond the scope of merely controlling illegal immigration. Advocates argue that a fortified border is essential for safeguarding the nation against various threats, drawing historical parallels to China's Great Wall, which was constructed to deter foreign invaders rather than immigrants. 

The current security landscape along the U.S.-Mexico border is increasingly complex, with Mexico facing significant challenges due to the dominance of drug cartels. These organizations have contributed to a troubling rise in violence and death tolls in the region, underscoring the need for enhanced border security measures. 

One of the pressing concerns among security experts is the potential for terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, to exploit vulnerabilities along the Southern Border. The fear is that unsecured entry points could allow individuals with malicious intent to breach U.S. territory. This anxiety was heightened following a recent incident where eight Syrian nationals allegedly attempted to enter the United States illegally from Mexico. This event has raised alarms in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, prompting calls for a reassessment of border security protocols.

Reports indicate that these individuals were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. However, the Border Patrol has yet to confirm the details surrounding this incident. National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza has acknowledged that agents have reported instances of Syrians attempting to cross the border. Garza has been vocal in his criticism of the previous administration, asserting that the Obama administration's policies hindered the Border Patrol's ability to effectively carry out its responsibilities.

In a stark revelation, Garza noted that ""eight out of ten"" individuals caught illegally entering the United States are not deported, raising significant questions about the efficacy of current enforcement strategies. This statistic highlights the challenges faced by Border Patrol agents and the urgency for reform in immigration policies.

With the increasing number of security concerns and incidents highlighting the vulnerabilities along the border, there is a growing emphasis on the necessity for stronger border security measures. Advocates are calling for a candidate who is committed to addressing these critical issues, ensuring that national security remains a top priority while also navigating the complexities of immigration reform. The ongoing debate underscores the delicate balance between maintaining security and managing immigration in a rapidly changing global landscape.",-13.0,-18.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,446.0,-1.0588235294117647,-0.04035874439461883

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

In a recent gathering, a group of Haitians expressed overwhelming support for former President Donald Trump, cheering enthusiastically as he listened to their personal stories. The event highlighted significant grievances directed towards former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, particularly concerning her and her family's involvement in Haiti's recovery efforts following the devastating earthquake in 2010.

Audience members voiced strong complaints about the Clintons’ lack of follow-up after receiving donations intended for Haiti. Many attendees believe that the funds meant to aid the impoverished nation were instead diverted to lobbyists in Washington and the White House. This sentiment was echoed by accusations aimed at Hillary Clinton for allegedly obstructing a proposed increase in Haiti's daily minimum wage from $3 to $5, further exacerbating the struggles faced by the Haitian people.

Interestingly, as the audience's support for Trump and their criticisms of Hillary became evident, media representatives chose to leave the event prematurely. Their departure raised eyebrows, as it suggested a reluctance to cover narratives that did not align with their usual portrayal of Trump. Instead of documenting the audience's experiences and opinions, the media opted out, leaving behind a conversation that could have shed light on the complexities of Haitian-American sentiments towards political figures.

The actions of the media have drawn criticism, with observers noting that they missed an opportunity to engage with a community eager to share their perspectives.",-2.0,-5.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,269.0,-0.5555555555555556,-0.01858736059479554
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

In a climate marked by increasing fears of terrorism, a recent poll reveals a significant shift in Australian public opinion regarding Muslim immigration. The survey indicates that support for a ban on Muslim immigration has surged to 49%, a notable increase from just 28% last October. This growing sentiment is reflective of broader societal views as Australians grapple with issues surrounding integration and national security.

The proposal for a ban on Muslim immigration echoes sentiments previously expressed by prominent political figures, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, who suggested halting Muslim immigration until a better understanding of terrorism is achieved. While this stance has drawn accusations of racism from various quarters, it is crucial to note that racism is defined by beliefs about race, whereas Islam is a religion. The potential for radicalization within any religious group, including Islam, raises complex questions about immigration policy and national security.

The poll results show that nearly half of the Australian electorate believes a national debate on the topic is necessary, with 48% of voters in favor of discussing the implications of Muslim immigration. The findings also highlight a significant alignment with the views of populist senator Pauline Hanson, as two-thirds of respondents agree with her stance on controversial topics related to immigration and integration.

Among the key reasons cited for supporting the ban are fears of terrorism and the perception that Muslim migrants do not adequately integrate into Australian society. This perception has fueled a growing divide in how different political factions view immigration. Notably, support for the ban transcends traditional political boundaries, with 60% of right-wing Coalition voters, 40% of Labour voters, and 34% of Green voters expressing support for restrictions on Muslim immigration.

The pollster behind the survey expressed surprise at the substantial backing for the ban, emphasizing that it reflects a widespread sentiment rather than the views of a marginalized group. This trend suggests a significant shift in the political landscape, as public opinion increasingly aligns with stricter immigration policies.

Critics of the current political discourse, including figures like Hillary Clinton, have been scrutinized for their approach to opposing views. The article suggests that recognizing and engaging with differing opinions may prove more effective than resorting to derogatory labels. This perspective advocates for a more nuanced discussion surrounding immigration and integration, rather than dismissing concerns as mere prejudice.

As Australia navigates the complexities of immigration policy in relation to national security, the rising support for a ban on Muslim immigration underscores the urgency of addressing public concerns. The call for a national debate reflects a desire for transparency and dialogue on the implications of immigration in a rapidly changing world.

In conclusion, the significant increase in support for a Muslim immigration ban signals a pivotal moment in Australian politics. As the nation continues to grapple with issues of integration, security, and the challenges posed by radicalization, the need for informed discussion and understanding becomes ever more critical. The evolving public sentiment may shape future policies, prompting a re-evaluation of how Australia approaches immigration and the responsibilities that come with it.",2.0,13.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,578.0,0.6190476190476191,0.02249134948096886

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on

In a shocking incident that unfolded in the heart of the city, a street fight escalated into chaos when an unknown individual unexpectedly set the combatants ablaze. Eyewitness accounts describe a scene of pandemonium as the victims, engulfed in flames, fled into the street, narrowly avoiding oncoming traffic.

The incident has drawn significant media attention, particularly following Buzzfeed's assertion that the description of the crime and its victims is inaccurate. However, the article in question firmly maintains that these claims have been debunked, emphasizing the gravity of the situation as it occurred.

As the fight erupted, bystanders were left in disbelief at the turn of events. The use of a Molotov cocktail—a crude incendiary device—raises troubling questions about the premeditated nature of the attack. The author of the article expressed profound astonishment at such reckless behavior, highlighting the potential for severe injury or even loss of life in a situation that spiraled out of control.

In a nostalgic reflection, the author reminisced about a time when community members would intervene to ensure safety during altercations, rather than standing by with their phones, recording the chaos for social media. This shift in societal behavior underscores a disturbing trend where the allure of viral videos often eclipses basic human compassion and concern for the wellbeing of others.

As the victims frantically sought refuge, the scene became increasingly dangerous, with cars swerving to avoid them. The juxtaposition of violence and the indifference of onlookers paints a grim picture of modern society, where the instinct to help has been overshadowed by the desire to capture sensational moments for online consumption.

Critics of this trend argue that it reflects a broader cultural shift, one that prioritizes entertainment over empathy. The article serves as a poignant reminder of the need for individuals to reclaim the values of compassion and community, urging readers to consider their role in fostering a safer environment.

The chaotic incident not only raises questions about public safety but also serves as a call to action for society to reassess its priorities. As discussions continue about the implications of such violence and the societal trends that enable it, one thing remains clear: the need for a return to a culture that values human life and safety over fleeting internet fame.",-5.0,-42.0,444.0,-0.17857142857142858,-0.01126126126126126,425.0,-2.8,-0.0988235294117647

(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The need for a border wall is emphasized not only for preventing illegal immigration but also for securing access points into America.

Luna County, New Mexico, is experiencing heightened security measures following a routine traffic stop that involved an undocumented woman from the Middle East. The incident has intensified discussions surrounding the need for a border wall, not only to deter illegal immigration but also to secure vital access points into the United States.

The woman, identified as an “Islamic refugee,” was found to have plans related to a nearby gas pipeline. This revelation has sparked alarm among local law enforcement and national security agencies, as authorities are left uncertain about her intentions regarding the pipeline. In response to the situation, the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and U.S. Border Patrol were called to investigate but reported no immediate threats stemming from the incident.

The pipeline in question is situated in a remote area, leading to suspicions that the woman may have been scouting the location for potential future attacks. The presence of an undocumented Muslim woman near the U.S.-Mexico border has further fueled concerns, as many fear that such individuals could be part of broader terrorist plots.

Adding to the unease is a 2015 report by Judicial Watch, which indicated that Mexican cartels have been collaborating with terrorist organizations to smuggle individuals from nations afflicted by terrorism into the United States. A subsequent report in 2017 highlighted that Islamic terror groups based in Mexico have crossed the border to scout potential targets, raising alarms about the vulnerabilities along the southern border.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call for Congress to allocate funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall. Proponents argue that constructing a barrier is essential not only for preventing illegal immigration but also for safeguarding the country from potential terrorist threats and drug cartels. The argument posits that many illegal immigrants entering the U.S. are not solely from Mexico but often travel from further south, frequently with the support of the Mexican government.

The urgency of building a border wall is underscored by the belief that terrorists could easily exploit gaps in border security to enter the United States. As law enforcement agencies in Luna County remain vigilant, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing debates surrounding national security and immigration policy. The community is left to grapple with the implications of this traffic stop, as officials work to ensure the safety of residents and the integrity of the nation’s borders.",-44.0,-26.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,456.0,-1.7333333333333334,-0.05701754385964912
Fake_53-Webpage,CNN’s Post-Debate Rigged Poll Busted…Here Are The Real Results,"We’re shocked — SHOCKED — to learn that CNN’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Not to be outdone, NBC followed up with a similar poll in which there were 14% more Democrats than Republicans.",,,,,,,,,{},"- CNN's bias is perceived as blatant in their reporting and moderation.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is not just known for his impressive skills on the football field; he is also recognized for his deep commitment to his faith and his desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others. Wilson has consistently emphasized his love for God and his mission to help those around him, aiming to create a legacy filled with joy and compassion.

On the field, Wilson is laser-focused on winning games and leading his team to victory. However, off the field, his priorities shift toward promoting joy and peace through his unwavering faith and the positive choices he makes. This dual focus illustrates Wilson's belief that success in sports can coexist with a commitment to serving others and uplifting communities.

Despite the challenges he faces in expressing his faith, Wilson remains steadfast in his beliefs. The NFL has advised players to refrain from discussing their faith publicly, but Wilson finds ways to showcase his values through his actions. He demonstrates that one can maintain a strong spiritual foundation while navigating the pressures of professional sports. 

For Wilson, the order of his priorities is clear: God comes first, followed by family and friends, with football taking a backseat. This hierarchy, he asserts, is the source of his strength and resilience. By prioritizing his faith and relationships over the demands of his career, Wilson believes he can achieve positive outcomes and reduce the stress that often accompanies life as a professional athlete.

However, Wilson's perspective raises important questions about the nature of leadership and influence in society. The article critiques individuals in positions of power who seem to forget their roots and instead use their influence for self-glorification. In a world where corruption and deception often dominate the headlines, Wilson's commitment to authenticity and service stands in stark contrast to the actions of some leaders who prioritize personal gain over the welfare of others.

The author expresses frustration over the double standards that exist regarding freedom of speech, particularly when it comes to discussing faith. While various messages are freely shared in public discourse, expressing one's spiritual beliefs appears to be met with resistance or skepticism. This selective acceptance of speech raises concerns about the societal values that are championed and those that are marginalized.

Moreover, the article questions the societal perception of serving others and promoting happiness. When did these noble pursuits become viewed negatively? Wilson's approach to life challenges the notion that faith and joy should be sidelined in favor of more secular or self-serving narratives. His dedication to uplifting others through his actions serves as a reminder that true leadership involves a commitment to the greater good.

As the discussion unfolds, it is essential to recognize the importance of truth in the face of societal corruption. Wilson's journey exemplifies the impact one individual can have when they prioritize service, love, and joy. In a time when many are disillusioned by the actions of those in power, Wilson's example serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration.

In conclusion, Russell Wilson's life and career illustrate the powerful intersection of faith, service, and leadership. His unwavering commitment to God and his desire to help others stand as a testament to the positive change that can emerge when individuals prioritize love and compassion in their lives. As we navigate a complex world, let us remember the importance of truth and the profound impact of serving one another.",79.0,113.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,647.0,4.185185185185185,0.17465224111282843
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

In a thought-provoking discussion with Italy's press, Pope Francis has raised significant concerns regarding the role of media in shaping public perception and societal anxiety. The Pontiff criticized what he termed ""fear-based media,"" equating it to ""terrorism,"" and condemned journalism that relies on gossip or rumors. His remarks come at a time when the influence of media on public sentiment is under intense scrutiny.

During the conversation, Pope Francis emphasized the detrimental effects of spreading rumors, stating that it can ""kill a person with your tongue."" He highlighted the powerful influence that journalists wield in society, urging them to take responsibility for their words and the impact they have on individuals and communities. The Pope's comments serve as a reminder of the ethical obligations that come with reporting, particularly in an age where misinformation can spread rapidly.

The discussion also touched on the broader implications of fear promoted by media outlets, particularly pointing to Fox News as a significant contributor to societal anxiety. Pope Francis suggested that such fear-mongering has not only influenced public sentiment but has also affected political figures, including former President Donald Trump. The Pope’s critique suggests that the sensationalism often found in media narratives can distort reality, creating an atmosphere of fear that overshadows factual evidence.

Despite statistics indicating a decrease in crime rates and low probabilities of dying from terrorism, public fear appears to be on the rise. Recent polls have shown that many individuals express increased worries about crime and terrorism, a phenomenon that seems at odds with the data. The Pope's observations align with a growing concern that mass shootings and public protests have contributed to a persistent sense of disorder, further exacerbating feelings of insecurity among the populace.

The article notes that Fox News has been identified as a major source of fear-mongering, with Forward Progressives providing examples of how the network has successfully instilled fear among viewers. This has raised questions about the responsibility of media outlets in shaping public discourse and the potential consequences of their narratives.

Pope Francis' remarks serve as a call to action for journalists and media organizations to prioritize ethical reporting and to consider the societal implications of their work. By addressing the issue of fear-based media, the Pontiff is encouraging a more responsible approach to journalism that fosters understanding rather than anxiety. As the media landscape continues to evolve, the Pope's insights remind us of the profound impact that words can have, urging a shift towards a more compassionate and truthful discourse.",-56.0,-35.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,478.0,-2.0588235294117645,-0.07322175732217573
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign. We all must wait and

These issues have been central to the campaign, sparking intense discussions among voters. Notably, CNN's poll results have been scrutinized for their methodology, as the network acknowledged that its sample pool leaned more Democrat, which may have influenced the outcome.

Following the debate, Trump took to Twitter to express gratitude to his supporters for their favorable polling, while Clinton has yet to make a public comment regarding the debate results. The mixed responses from CNN's polling also raised questions about whether the debate would significantly alter voters' decisions as the election draws near.

Trump didn't shy away from criticizing the conditions of the debate, claiming that he had a defective microphone, which he argued hampered his performance. He also suggested that he could have brought up former President Bill Clinton’s infidelity but chose not to, adding that he might reconsider his participation in future debates if conditions do not improve.

As the election approaches, both candidates have limited time to sway undecided voters, making each debate crucial. In a potential twist, Julian Assange hinted at an ""October surprise"" release on Wikileaks that could have significant implications for Clinton's campaign, further intensifying the stakes as the candidates head into the final stretch of the race. With the political landscape shifting rapidly, the impact of the debate and upcoming revelations remain to be seen.",18.0,7.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,356.0,0.5384615384615384,0.019662921348314606
Fake_57-Webpage,Hillary Thought She Won The Debate. Didn’t Expect This To Happen To Prove Her Wrong.,"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t.

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

In the wake of a contentious presidential debate, Hillary Clinton has declared victory, yet reactions from various focus groups and social media indicate a more complex narrative. While Clinton confidently asserted her triumph, polling data suggests a divided public perception.

Focus groups conducted by both CNN and Fox News reveal a stark contrast in opinions. CNN's group, comprised of Florida voters, overwhelmingly favored Clinton by a margin of 18 to 2. Conversely, a focus group from Fox News, made up of voters from Pennsylvania, showed a more competitive landscape, with Clinton receiving a favorable nod from 16 participants to Trump's 6.

Pollster Frank Luntz provided insight into the candidates' performances during the debate. He noted that Trump struggled significantly when discussing his taxes but showed improvement when addressing Clinton's email controversy. However, Trump's attempts to explain his long-standing questioning of President Obama's birthplace appeared to hinder his overall performance, leaving some viewers dissatisfied.

Adding to the debate's complexity, an alternative poll from the Drudge Report indicated a vastly different outcome, with Trump allegedly winning 92% to Clinton's 8%. This stark discrepancy has fueled further debate among analysts and supporters alike.

Following Clinton's declaration of victory on social media, a significant backlash ensued. The hashtag #TrumpWon quickly began trending globally, reflecting a segment of the audience that felt differently about the debate's outcome. Critics have pointed out Clinton's tendency to avoid media scrutiny in the aftermath of the debate, raising questions about her willingness to engage with challenging questions.

As the dust settles on the debate, it is clear that while Clinton may have proclaimed victory, the public's response is far from unanimous. The contrasting focus group results and the social media reaction underscore the ongoing divide among voters as the election season heats up. With both candidates facing scrutiny, the path to the presidency remains fraught with challenges and uncertainties.",18.0,22.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,373.0,1.375,0.058981233243967826
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC – Protests erupted for the second consecutive night in Charlotte, ignited by the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott, a 30-year-old man whose death has prompted widespread outrage and demands for accountability. The demonstrations, initially peaceful, took a violent turn when a civilian was critically injured after being shot in the head during the unrest. 

Eyewitness accounts from the scene paint a troubling picture of the events that unfolded. While police initially claimed that a civilian was responsible for the shooting, numerous witnesses have come forward to suggest otherwise, indicating possible police involvement. The conflicting narratives have only fueled tensions in a city already on edge.

Todd Zimmer, an eyewitness to the shooting, shared a graphic photo on social media, expressing his disbelief and frustration. ""My city is lying about what happened tonight,"" he stated, underscoring the growing mistrust between the community and law enforcement. Zimmer's comments reflect a broader sentiment among protesters who feel that the official narrative does not align with their experiences.

Kahran Meyer, a criminal defense lawyer and another eyewitness, took to Twitter to voice his concerns. He asserted that he witnessed the shooting firsthand and firmly stated, ""It was not by a civilian."" His remarks add to the chorus of voices challenging the police's account and raise questions about the transparency of the investigation into the incident.

The protests began peacefully, drawing around 1,000 participants who gathered to express their outrage over Scott's death. Holding signs and chanting ""Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,"" the crowd initially sought to honor Scott's memory and demand justice. However, as tensions escalated, the atmosphere shifted dramatically when riot police arrived on the scene.

Eyewitnesses reported that the sound of gunfire was much louder than typical firearms, leading them to believe it was police gunfire that injured the civilian. This perception has only heightened fears and suspicions regarding the police's role in the incident. The arrival of riot police marked a turning point in the protests, as the situation became increasingly volatile.

In response to the shooting, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police took a hardline approach, reading the riot act to protesters. Shortly thereafter, they deployed tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd. This aggressive tactic has been met with condemnation from many in the community who argue that it exacerbated an already tense situation.

Multiple eyewitness accounts, including those from local clergy, have refuted the police's claims regarding the shooter. These testimonies attribute the shooting to law enforcement, further complicating the narrative surrounding the incident. A witness described the scene, stating that the victim was shot while standing between two ministers, characterizing it as an ""ambush."" This description paints a chilling picture of the chaos that unfolded and raises serious concerns about the use of force by police officers.

Another witness recounted the aftermath of the shooting, stating that they saw a man bleeding on the ground while police failed to provide assistance. The lack of immediate medical aid has drawn sharp criticism and has been highlighted as a failure of duty by those in law enforcement. This incident has only deepened the community's mistrust of the police, as many feel that their safety is not a priority.

As the protests continue, the call for justice in the case of Kenneth L. Scott grows louder. Community leaders and activists are demanding a thorough investigation into the shooting and the circumstances surrounding Scott's death. The events of the past two nights have underscored the urgent need for accountability and transparency from law enforcement.

The situation in Charlotte remains fluid, with protesters vowing to continue their demonstrations until their demands are met. The tragic events surrounding Kenneth L. Scott's death have ignited a firestorm of anger and frustration, reflecting a broader national conversation about police violence and systemic injustice. 

As the community grapples with the fallout from this incident, the eyes of the nation remain on Charlotte, where the fight for justice and accountability is far from over. The protests serve as a stark reminder of the deep divisions that exist in society and the urgent need for change. 

In the coming days, community leaders are expected to hold meetings and rallies to further mobilize support for their cause. The tragic shooting of a civilian during the protests has only intensified their resolve, as they seek to ensure that Scott's death does not go unanswered. 

As the situation continues to unfold, the community stands united in their demand for justice, hoping that their voices will be heard and that meaningful change will come from this tragedy. The protests in Charlotte are not just about one man's death; they represent a broader struggle against systemic issues that have plagued communities across the nation for far too long. 

In the wake of these events, many are left questioning the role of police in society and the measures taken to ensure public safety. The protests have become a platform for discussing these critical issues, as activists and community members seek to engage in meaningful dialogue about reform and accountability.

The coming days will be crucial for the Charlotte community as they navigate the aftermath of this tragic incident. With tensions still high and emotions running deep, the path forward remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: the fight for justice in the case of Kenneth L. Scott will not be silenced. The community's resilience and determination to seek accountability will continue to shape the narrative surrounding police violence and systemic injustice in the United States. 

As Charlotte grapples with the events of the past few nights, it is essential to remember that the fight for justice is ongoing. The voices of the community will not be drowned out, and the demand for accountability will echo long after the protests have subsided. The tragic loss of Kenneth L. Scott serves as a rallying cry for change, and the community's commitment to justice will not waver in the face of adversity. 

In the days ahead, the focus will remain on the investigation into the shooting and the broader implications it holds for law enforcement practices. The community stands at a crossroads, with the potential for significant change on the horizon if their demands are met. The eyes of the nation are watching as Charlotte continues to confront its past and fight for a more just and equitable future.",-74.0,-101.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,1193.0,-2.02,-0.08466051969823973
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

As the political landscape heats up in the United States, Republican nominee Donald Trump finds himself at the center of a growing storm of criticism regarding his foreign policy, particularly his apparent alignment with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This scrutiny has intensified as investigations reveal troubling connections between Trump and Russian interests, raising questions about the implications for U.S. national security and foreign relations.

Critics argue that Trump's foreign policy appears to favor Putin, a leader whose actions on the global stage have drawn widespread condemnation. Trump’s associations with individuals linked to the Kremlin further exacerbate these concerns. His campaign has been characterized by the presence of advisors and associates who have established ties with Russian officials, leading many to speculate about the influence these relationships may have on his policy decisions.

Adding to the controversy, Trump has received significant support from Russian state media and intelligence services. This backing has raised alarms among political analysts and opponents, who view it as a troubling endorsement that could skew his approach to international relations. Despite Trump's assertions that he has no business dealings with Russia, an investigation by ABC News has uncovered ""numerous ties"" to Russian interests that amount to hundreds of millions of dollars.

The nature of these ties is particularly alarming. Trump has profited from various business dealings involving Russian oligarchs, who have amassed their wealth through the acquisition of state-owned companies in Russia. Notably, Trump hosted the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow, a high-profile event that served as a platform for his brand and connections in the country. Additionally, he has engaged in real estate transactions with Russian buyers, further solidifying his financial entanglements with individuals closely aligned with the Kremlin.

These Russian oligarchs, characterized by former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev as materialistic and culturally ignorant, often use their wealth to bolster Putin's regime while simultaneously enriching themselves. Their financial activities, including the purchase of Trump properties, have been identified as favored methods for laundering money, raising serious ethical questions about the implications of such transactions for U.S. interests.

In the wake of U.S. sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs in 2014, Trump’s comments regarding these sanctions have drawn particular scrutiny. He suggested that, if elected, he would consider lifting these sanctions, a stance that many see as a direct conflict of interest. This raises significant concerns about whether Trump would prioritize the financial interests tied to his business dealings over the national interests of the United States.

The potential conflict of interest between Trump's personal finances and U.S. foreign policy has prompted calls for action. Critics argue that it is imperative to address these alleged conflicts and corrupt influences before they can further undermine the integrity of the U.S. government and its foreign policy objectives. The situation has led some to advocate for drastic measures, including impeachment, as a means of holding Trump accountable for his connections to Russia and the implications they pose for national security.

As the election approaches, the narrative surrounding Trump's ties to Russia is likely to remain a focal point of debate. The implications of his business dealings and the influence of foreign interests on U.S. policy cannot be understated. With national security at stake, voters and political leaders alike are urged to consider the ramifications of electing a candidate whose financial entanglements may compromise the integrity of the presidency.

In conclusion, the controversy surrounding Trump's foreign policy and connections to Russia highlights the complexities of modern political landscapes, where personal finances and national interests often intersect in troubling ways. As scrutiny continues to mount, the call for accountability grows louder, signaling that the implications of Trump's actions will resonate far beyond the election cycle. The American public is left to grapple with the question of whether their next leader can truly prioritize the nation's interests over personal profit, a dilemma that will undoubtedly shape the future of U.S. foreign policy.",27.0,0.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,737.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is facing a potential impeachment crisis as state legislators weigh the possibility of filing articles of impeachment related to the infamous George Washington Bridge scandal, commonly referred to as ""Bridgegate."" The controversy centers on allegations that Christie orchestrated the closure of access lanes to the bridge in an effort to punish a political rival, a move that resulted in significant traffic delays and, tragically, one death.

Top state legislators are currently deliberating on the next steps, with a focus on whether Christie should be held accountable if he is found guilty of orchestrating the closures. The decision to move forward with impeachment proceedings ultimately rests with Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto. If Prieto approves the motion, the Assembly Judiciary Committee will begin the formal process of impeachment.

For impeachment to proceed, a majority vote in the 80-member Assembly is required. Should the Assembly vote in favor, a two-thirds vote in the Senate would be necessary for a conviction. The stakes are high, as the outcome could significantly impact Christie's political future.

Adding to the mounting pressure, a judge has ordered Christie to produce personal emails related to the Bridgegate scandal. This ruling could provide further insight into Christie's involvement in the events surrounding the bridge closures. Federal prosecutors have already implicated Christie in the trial of three senior aides, alleging that he was complicit in the scheme that caused widespread traffic chaos.

Christie’s political trajectory has taken a notable turn in recent years. His endorsement of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign was seen as a pivotal moment in his career, marking a significant shift that many observers interpreted as a decline in his political influence. Despite his role as chairperson for Trump's transition team, Christie has struggled to maintain the same level of political capital he once enjoyed.

The Bridgegate scandal itself has been a dark cloud over Christie's administration since its inception. In January 2014, shortly after his re-election, Christie publicly denied any knowledge of the scandal during a press conference. However, evidence has since emerged suggesting that he was informed about the bridge closures during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 but failed to take any action.

The implications of these allegations are profound, as they highlight not only Christie's potential legal troubles but also the overarching narrative of his political downfall. Accusations of lying and political bullying have marred his reputation, leading many to question his leadership and integrity.

As the political landscape in New Jersey evolves, the potential for impeachment looms large over Christie. The coming weeks will be crucial as legislators consider the evidence and determine the appropriate course of action. With the eyes of the nation on New Jersey, the outcome of this situation could have far-reaching consequences for Christie's future and for the state's political climate as a whole.

In a state that has seen its fair share of political scandals, the Bridgegate controversy stands out as a defining moment for Governor Chris Christie.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In September 2015, Donald Trump made a bold assertion regarding his past interactions with Florida Governor Jeb Bush, claiming he never lobbied for casino gambling. ""If I wanted to, I would have succeeded,"" he stated confidently, suggesting that his influence was sufficient to sway the political landscape if he had truly desired it. However, this declaration raises pressing questions surrounding the veracity of his claims, particularly in light of his testimony during a civil court deposition in 2007, where he admitted to lobbying for changes in Florida's gambling laws.

The implications of this contradiction are significant, as they suggest potential perjury. If Trump did indeed lie under oath, it would not only damage his credibility but could also lead to legal ramifications. This situation serves as a stark reminder of the complexities surrounding truth and deception in the political arena, especially for a figure as polarizing as Trump.

The article delves into the motivations behind Trump's statements, proposing that he often fabricates narratives to evade the reality of failure. His attempts to influence Florida's gambling regulations have been a point of contention, and Trump's denial of lobbying efforts appears to be an attempt to reshape his public image. This strategy of obfuscation is not new; rather, it reflects a broader pattern of behavior that has characterized his political career.

During a debate, Jeb Bush directly challenged Trump’s assertions. ""You did try to change my anti-gambling stance,"" Bush asserted, countering Trump's claims and emphasizing the reality of their interactions. This exchange not only highlights the ongoing rivalry between the two political figures but also underscores the growing scrutiny of Trump's past actions and statements. Bush's insistence on the truth of the matter places further pressure on Trump to clarify his position, yet the former president has continued to maintain his narrative.

The dispute between Trump and Bush is emblematic of a larger issue: the credibility of political figures in the public eye. Trump's history of misleading statements raises concerns about the integrity of his claims, whether they are made to the public or in legal settings. The potential consequences of such dishonesty are profound, particularly for a candidate seeking the highest office in the land. As the nation grapples with issues of trust and transparency in leadership, Trump's alleged fabrications pose a threat to the very fabric of democratic discourse.

Drawing parallels to historical events, the article likens Trump's situation to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton, who faced serious consequences for lying under oath. The gravity of such actions cannot be understated; lying in a legal context is a serious offense that undermines the rule of law. Trump's alleged dishonesty, if proven, could have similarly far-reaching implications, not only for his political career but also for the integrity of the electoral process.

The article further explores the ramifications of Trump's consistent pattern of misleading statements. As a presidential candidate, his credibility is paramount, yet his history of fabrications raises alarms about national safety and integrity. The potential for a leader who bends the truth to fit their narrative poses risks not only domestically but also on the international stage. A president's words carry weight, and the ability to trust those words is essential for maintaining a stable and secure nation.

To illustrate the discrepancies in Trump's statements, the article includes relevant transcripts from both the debate and the 2007 deposition. In the deposition, Trump acknowledged his lobbying efforts, starkly contrasting his later claims of never having pursued changes to Florida's gambling laws. This inconsistency paints a troubling picture of a leader who may not only misrepresent his past but also manipulate facts to serve his interests.

In the deposition, Trump stated, ""I was involved in lobbying for casino gambling in Florida,"" a statement that directly contradicts his assertion made years later. This admission raises further questions about the authenticity of his claims and the motivations behind them. The juxtaposition of these statements reveals a troubling pattern of behavior that has become increasingly difficult to ignore.

As the debate over Trump's credibility continues, the implications for his political future remain uncertain. The public's trust in their leaders is fragile, and repeated instances of dishonesty can erode that trust. For a candidate vying for the presidency, maintaining credibility is crucial. However, as the evidence mounts against him, Trump's ability to convince the electorate of his integrity becomes increasingly tenuous.

In conclusion, the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's lobbying efforts for casino gambling in Florida serves as a microcosm of broader issues related to truthfulness in politics. His claims of never having lobbied, juxtaposed with his 2007 deposition, expose significant discrepancies that raise questions about his credibility. The implications of these contradictions extend beyond personal accountability; they touch upon the very essence of democratic governance and the trust that citizens place in their leaders.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, the importance of honesty and integrity in leadership cannot be overstated. The stakes are high, and the potential consequences of misleading statements are profound. In a time when the nation seeks transparency and accountability, the scrutiny of figures like Trump serves as a crucial reminder of the need for truth in politics. The gamble of truth may ultimately determine the future of leadership in America, and the outcome remains to be seen.",-29.0,-16.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,1019.0,-0.3902439024390244,-0.015701668302257114
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers watched a 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and turned it into a drinking game.

As millions tuned in to watch a 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN, many viewers turned the event into a drinking game, raising concerns about public safety. US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has issued a stark warning regarding the potential dangers of such games, especially those centered around the falsehoods of former President Donald Trump.

Murthy cautioned that drinking games based on Trump's frequent fabrications could lead to serious health risks, including alcohol poisoning. This warning comes in light of previous advisories about the hazards of drinking games during GOP debates, particularly given the candidates' track records. 

The Surgeon General's concerns are not unfounded. In 2012, there were approximately 70,000 reported incidents of alcohol poisoning linked to debate drinking games. The risks were highlighted again before the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump on September 26, 2016, when similar warnings were issued.

A recent study by Politico further underscores the gravity of the situation. The report revealed that Trump told 87 lies in just a five-day period from September 15 to September 20, averaging a lie every 3 minutes and 15 seconds. Extrapolating from this average, it is estimated that Trump likely told about 28 lies during the recent CNN debate, a figure that could prompt excessive drinking among viewers participating in the game.

In light of these statistics, Murthy has advised viewers to exercise caution while watching future debates. He emphasized that first responders were preparing for potential alcohol-related incidents following the debate, indicating a proactive approach to public health safety.

As the political landscape continues to evolve, viewers are reminded to drink responsibly, particularly when engaging in drinking games that revolve around the propensity for dishonesty displayed by candidates like Trump.

Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In a contentious debate that has captivated the nation, Hillary Clinton has been declared the winner by mainstream media outlets. However, the narrative surrounding the debate has taken a sharp turn in the digital realm, where online polls and Twitter trends suggest a different outcome, with the hashtag #TrumpWon rapidly gaining traction.

Interestingly, the #TrumpWon trend originated in St. Petersburg, Russia, raising concerns about the authenticity of the online sentiment. Russian dictator Vladimir Putin has long been known for employing cyber-trolls and bloggers to orchestrate disinformation campaigns aimed at sowing discord within the U.S. political landscape. These trolls are tasked with amplifying divisions among Americans, often skewing public perception and influencing political discourse.

In addition to their domestic strategies, Russian state-controlled media has been actively promoting Donald Trump to European audiences, further complicating the narrative. Analysts suggest that Putin's ultimate goal is to manipulate Trump into lifting economic sanctions against Russian oligarchs, a move that could significantly benefit the Kremlin.

Ex-bloggers from Russia have come forward to describe their working conditions as harsh, characterized by strict oversight and severe penalties for failing to meet quotas. These revelations highlight the lengths to which foreign entities will go to influence American politics and public opinion.

Given the emergence of these trends and the potential for foreign interference, experts are warning the public against placing too much trust in online polls and engaging with what could be Russian trolls. The manipulation of digital platforms poses a serious threat to the integrity of political discourse in the United States.

In light of these developments, there is a growing call for Congress to take decisive action against Donald Trump. Many advocates are urging impeachment proceedings, arguing that the president's connections to foreign influence and his handling of domestic issues warrant serious scrutiny. The intersection of media narratives, online sentiment, and foreign interference presents a complex challenge for American democracy, one that demands careful consideration and action from lawmakers.

As the debate continues to unfold, it remains crucial for the public to remain vigilant and discerning in their consumption of information. The implications of these online trends extend far beyond a single debate, potentially shaping the future of U.S. politics in ways that are yet to be fully understood.",-9.0,2.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,425.0,0.125,0.004705882352941176
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, a prominent data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel, is currently embroiled in a federal lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Labor. The lawsuit alleges that the company has engaged in systematic discrimination against Asian job applicants during its hiring processes, raising significant concerns about fairness and equity within the workplace.

As a federal contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), Palantir is subject to strict regulations regarding employment practices. The lawsuit claims that out of 130 applicants vying for engineering intern positions, a staggering 73% were Asian. However, the hiring outcomes starkly revealed a disparity: only four Asian candidates were offered positions, compared to 17 non-Asian candidates. This data has prompted the Department of Labor to assert that the likelihood of such an outcome occurring by chance is estimated to be one in a billion, further intensifying the scrutiny on Palantir's hiring practices.

The implications of this lawsuit extend beyond Palantir itself, highlighting broader issues of discrimination within the tech industry, particularly against Asian professionals. The allegations suggest a troubling pattern that could reflect systemic biases in hiring practices, which federal contractors are obligated to address. The Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) at the Department of Labor emphasized the critical responsibility of federal contractors to ensure non-discriminatory hiring practices, underscoring the legal and ethical standards expected from organizations that engage with the government.

Peter Thiel, who has been a polarizing figure in the tech and political landscapes, is at the helm of Palantir. A first-generation immigrant, Thiel has been a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, who has taken a firm stance against immigration. This juxtaposition raises questions about Thiel’s advocacy for individual identity and his company’s alleged discriminatory practices. Thiel is well-known for his role as a co-founder of PayPal and as an early investor in Facebook, but his notoriety surged further when he funded Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker, which ultimately led to the media outlet's bankruptcy.

Thiel's political involvement has also made headlines, particularly when he became the first openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention. During his speech, he championed the importance of individual identity while simultaneously criticizing government incompetence. However, despite his progressive stance on personal identity, the Republican Party has faced criticism for adopting one of the most anti-LGBT platforms in its history, creating a complex narrative around Thiel's political affiliations and personal beliefs.

In response to the lawsuit, a spokeswoman for Palantir stated that the company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. This assertion indicates the firm’s commitment to contesting the claims and maintaining its reputation in the competitive tech landscape. The outcome of this legal battle may have significant repercussions not only for Palantir but also for the broader tech industry, as it could set a precedent for how employment discrimination cases are handled, especially concerning federal contractors.

As the case unfolds, it will be crucial to monitor how Palantir navigates these allegations and what measures, if any, the company will implement to address potential biases in its hiring processes. The lawsuit serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges related to diversity and inclusion within the tech sector, highlighting the need for companies to actively foster equitable hiring practices.

The Department of Labor's actions reflect a broader commitment to ensuring that federal contractors adhere to non-discriminatory practices, reinforcing the importance of accountability in the hiring process. As the legal proceedings progress, stakeholders will be watching closely to see how this case impacts Palantir, its leadership, and the industry at large. The outcome could have lasting implications for employment practices within federal contracting and the tech world, where diversity and inclusion remain critical issues.",-18.0,-9.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,707.0,-0.375,-0.01272984441301273

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

The Chelsea neighborhood of New York City remains on high alert following a bombing incident that occurred last Saturday, which injured 29 individuals. Fortunately, all victims have since been discharged from local hospitals, but the investigation into the attack is intensifying. Authorities are focusing their efforts on potential links to Muslim extremists as they sift through the evidence.

In the wake of the initial explosion, a second pressure-cooker bomb was discovered in a Dumpster just four blocks away, raising concerns about the possibility of further attacks. This discovery has prompted police to explore several significant leads that have emerged during the investigation.

One of the most critical pieces of evidence is a hand-written letter that was found alongside the second bomb. This letter is partially written in Arabic, and investigators are working to decipher its contents to determine its relevance to the bombing. The presence of the letter suggests a deliberate attempt to communicate a message, which may provide insight into the motives behind the attack.

Adding to the urgency of the situation, an unidentified male caller contacted 911 to issue a chilling warning. The caller stated, “There will be more,” raising alarms about the potential for additional explosions. This threat has heightened concerns among law enforcement and the public alike, as they grapple with the implications of such a statement.

Another notable lead in the investigation is a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber,’ which appears to serve as a manifesto for the alleged perpetrator. The page discusses various societal issues, including the treatment of the LGBTQ+ community, and expresses anger towards perceived inequalities. The author of the post claims that the recent explosions were merely tests, suggesting that more attacks could be on the horizon.

While the Tumblr post offers a glimpse into the mindset of the individual behind the bombing, there is skepticism regarding its authenticity. Critics have emerged, suggesting that those who exploit such tragic events for attention should not be taken seriously. The investigation team remains cautious, understanding that not all claims made online can be trusted.

As police continue to follow these leads, the community is left grappling with the implications of the bombing. Local residents are expressing their concerns about safety and the potential for further violence. The investigation into the Chelsea bombing is ongoing, with law enforcement urging anyone with information to come forward.

The incident has sparked discussions about the broader issues raised in the Tumblr manifesto, particularly regarding societal treatment of marginalized groups. Activists and community leaders are calling for a deeper examination of the factors that contribute to such acts of violence, urging society to address the underlying grievances that may fuel extremist behavior.

In the coming days, authorities are expected to release more information as they piece together the evidence and work to identify the individuals responsible for this heinous act. As the investigation unfolds, the community remains vigilant, hoping for swift justice and a return to normalcy in the wake of this shocking event.

With the investigation still in its early stages, many questions remain unanswered. The police are committed to uncovering the truth behind the Chelsea bombing and ensuring the safety of the public. As they pursue these leads, they are also mindful of the need to approach the investigation with care, understanding the delicate balance between addressing security concerns and respecting the rights of individuals in the community.",-25.0,-22.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,638.0,-0.8148148148148148,-0.034482758620689655
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on September 25, 2016, the ongoing presidential campaign has brought to light concerns regarding the mental fitness of candidates, particularly Donald Trump. As the 70-year-old Republican nominee intensifies his campaign efforts, the signs of his potential unfitness for public speaking have become increasingly evident.

With the pressure mounting, Trump is preparing for a significant debate against Hillary Clinton, a world-class politician known for her extensive experience and debate skills. However, the demands of campaigning have taken a toll on Trump, who is reportedly engaging in the process with little rest. This relentless schedule raises questions about his ability to effectively communicate and present himself during high-stakes situations.

In a last-minute effort to rally support before the crucial debate, Trump held an impromptu rally in Roanoke. Observers noted that his mental state appeared to be strained, suggesting he may be overwhelmed by the challenges of the campaign. The stress of competing against a seasoned politician like Clinton could be contributing to a decline in his cognitive clarity.

Adding to these concerns, Trump recently posted an incoherent tweet that covered three unrelated topics: a shooting in Washington State, drug overdoses in Ohio, and riots in North Carolina. This tweet not only reflects a wandering mind but also indicates a lack of coherent messaging, which is critical for a candidate seeking to connect with voters and present a unified campaign platform.

The content of Trump's tweet raises alarms about his readiness to engage in a debate with Clinton. The ability to articulate thoughts clearly and address complex issues is paramount in such settings, and the disjointed nature of his recent communication may signal a decline in his campaign's effectiveness. As the debate approaches, the question remains: is Donald Trump fit to stand alongside one of the most experienced politicians in modern history?

As the political landscape evolves, the implications of Trump's mental state and communication style could have lasting effects on his campaign and the upcoming debate. Observers will be watching closely to see how these factors play out in the days leading up to one of the most anticipated political confrontations in recent history.",-22.0,10.0,403.0,-1.1,-0.05459057071960298,410.0,0.6666666666666666,0.024390243902439025

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Between Trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, Hillary’s health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it’s beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president.",http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/secret-video-records-massive-hillary-event-flop/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474291954000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-HZMqIkGoU,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/secret-video-records-massive-hillary-event-flop/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton.

Delaware, Ohio – In what was anticipated to be a bustling door-knocking event aimed at rallying local support, Hillary Clinton's campaign faced an unexpected turnout challenge on a recent afternoon. Scheduled for 1 PM, the event was designed to engage volunteers and energize supporters ahead of the upcoming election. However, the reality was starkly different, as only one attendee, a supporter of Donald Trump, showed up to document the proceedings.

The presence of the Trump supporter quickly became a focal point for Clinton's campaign staff, who asked him to leave once they recognized his affiliation. This unusual incident highlighted the stark contrast between the expectations for the event and the actual turnout. While the campaign had prepared for an influx of enthusiastic volunteers, only the staff members remained in attendance, leading to an atmosphere of disappointment.

Inside the campaign office, the scene was well-organized and stocked, indicating that preparations had been made for a larger turnout. The staff had set up resources and materials, anticipating a crowd of supporters eager to contribute to the campaign's grassroots efforts. Instead, the lack of engagement raised immediate concerns about Clinton's ground game and overall support in the region.

The disparity in attendance at Clinton's event compared to the packed rallies often seen at Donald Trump's events could not have been more pronounced. Trump’s rallies are frequently reported to attract thousands of supporters, creating an atmosphere of fervor and excitement. In contrast, Clinton’s struggle to draw even a handful of attendees signals a potential enthusiasm gap that could have serious implications as the election approaches.

Political observers are beginning to speculate that this trend may signal a significant disadvantage for Clinton in the upcoming election. The enthusiasm gap, characterized by a lack of engagement among her supporters, poses questions about the effectiveness of her campaign strategies and the overall sentiment among voters. As the election cycle intensifies, the ability to mobilize grassroots support will be crucial for both candidates.

The events in Delaware serve as a microcosm of broader electoral dynamics, wherein the enthusiasm and commitment of supporters can heavily influence the outcome of an election. Clinton's campaign will need to reassess its strategies to reignite interest and participation among potential voters if it hopes to compete effectively against a candidate whose rallies are overflowing with supporters.

As the election season progresses, the ability to galvanize support at the local level will be essential. The stark contrast between the two candidates’ events could foreshadow challenges ahead for Clinton’s campaign. With Trump’s rallies serving as a testament to his widespread appeal, the Clinton campaign must find ways to bridge the enthusiasm gap and energize her base to ensure a competitive edge.

In conclusion, the door-knocking event in Delaware, Ohio, encapsulates the challenges faced by Clinton's campaign as it navigates the complex landscape of voter engagement. The solitary attendance of a Trump supporter, coupled with the absence of enthusiastic volunteers, underscores the need for a renewed focus on grassroots mobilization as the election approaches. With the stakes higher than ever, the coming weeks will be critical in determining whether Clinton can rally her supporters and mount a formidable challenge against her rival.",-7.0,38.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,614.0,1.6521739130434783,0.06188925081433225

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In the wake of a recent bombing in New York City, former President Donald Trump has made headlines with his immediate response, labeling the incident a “bombing.” His terminology sparked a wave of reactions, particularly from CNN, which took issue with his choice of words despite the fact that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had used the same term in her own commentary on the event.

CNN's criticism of Trump’s language came under scrutiny when it was revealed that the network had edited out Clinton's use of the word ""bombing"" from their coverage. This decision drew further ire from Trump, who voiced his discontent during an interview on the morning show Fox and Friends. He branded CNN as “disgusting and disgraceful,” asserting that their reporting was dishonest. In a pointed jab, Trump referred to CNN as the ""Clinton news network,"" suggesting a bias in their reporting that he believes favors the Democratic party.

In addition to criticizing the media, Trump seized the opportunity to address broader concerns regarding national security and terrorism. He expressed frustration with current leadership, labeling them as ""stupid"" and soft on terrorism. Trump emphasized the necessity for tougher measures to combat threats, arguing that the current administration's approach is insufficient. His remarks resonated with many who are concerned about the ongoing risks posed by terrorism in the United States.

A significant portion of Trump’s commentary focused on the issue of refugees, particularly in light of the bombing. He expressed deep concerns regarding the influx of refugees into the country, specifically targeting former President Barack Obama’s plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017. Trump argued that Clinton’s intention to increase that number would only exacerbate the situation. He has consistently maintained that the vetting process for incoming refugees is inadequate, raising alarms about the potential for individuals with harmful intentions to enter the United States under the guise of seeking asylum.

The debate over refugee policies has been a contentious issue in American politics, and Trump’s comments reflect a broader concern among some segments of the population about national security. His call for stricter vetting processes aligns with his long-standing stance on immigration and security, which he has made a cornerstone of his political identity.

As the situation unfolds, the reactions from both Trump and the media illustrate the polarized nature of contemporary political discourse. Trump’s remarks and CNN’s subsequent critique highlight the ongoing battle over narratives in the wake of significant national events. The former president's labeling of CNN as biased and his insistence on tougher measures against terrorism resonate with his supporters, while critics of his administration continue to challenge his views and rhetoric.

The bombing incident in New York City has not only reignited discussions about terrorism and national security but has also underscored the contentious relationship between Trump and major news outlets. As the political landscape continues to evolve, the implications of these discussions on public perception and policy remain to be seen. 

In conclusion, Trump’s immediate reaction to the bombing, coupled with his criticism of CNN and refugee policies, reflects a complex interplay of media relations and national security concerns. As both sides navigate this charged environment, the discourse surrounding terrorism, immigration, and media integrity is likely to remain at the forefront of public debate.",-45.0,-29.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,640.0,-1.3181818181818181,-0.0453125

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

In a surprising turn of events, Ahmad Rahami, a known terrorist and murderer, has filed a lawsuit against the police department in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The lawsuit centers around claims that his family has faced discrimination due to their cultural background, raising significant questions about the nature of the interactions between the Rahami family and local law enforcement.

Rahami's family has operated a chicken restaurant in Elizabeth since 2002, and they allege that local officials have engaged in a persistent campaign to harass them in an effort to shut down their business. The family claims to have received numerous tickets and court summons that they believe were unjustified, contributing to a hostile environment for their establishment.

The lawsuit also includes serious allegations of racial abuse directed at the Rahami family from local residents. They report experiencing derogatory comments related to their Muslim faith, which they assert has further compounded the discrimination they face in the community. Ahmad Rahami, along with his father, Mohammad Sr. (53), and his brother Mohammad, are all named in the lawsuit, highlighting the collective nature of their grievances against the police and the community.

A key point of contention in the lawsuit is the family's claim that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past the 10 PM closing time, despite holding the necessary permissions to do so. This alleged targeting, according to the Rahami family, is indicative of a broader pattern of harassment perpetrated by the Elizabeth police. They assert that their constitutional rights have been violated as a result of this treatment.

The lawsuit further claims that police officials have characterized the area surrounding the family’s restaurant as known for crime, a statement that the Rahami family disputes. This characterization, they argue, has been used as a pretext for the alleged harassment and discrimination they have endured.

The timing of the lawsuit raises questions about the motivations and actions of Ahmad Rahami, particularly in light of his criminal history. Five years after the allegations of harassment began, Rahami was arrested for planting bombs in New York City, a fact that casts a shadow over the current claims. Observers are left to ponder the implications of his legal actions and whether they are an attempt to deflect attention from his past.

As the lawsuit unfolds, it will be crucial to monitor the developments in this case, as it touches on broader issues of discrimination, community relations, and the responsibilities of law enforcement in diverse neighborhoods. The outcome may have significant repercussions for both the Rahami family and the Elizabeth police department as they navigate the complexities of this contentious situation.",-49.0,-61.0,476.0,-2.8823529411764706,-0.10294117647058823,500.0,-3.588235294117647,-0.122
Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

In the ongoing discourse surrounding pay-to-play corruption, the spotlight has once again fallen on Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. Initially, the Clinton campaign defended the foundation's activities, emphasizing its positive contributions in response to various corruption allegations. However, a closer examination reveals troubling financial practices that suggest the foundation may have primarily benefited the Clintons and their associates rather than serving its stated charitable mission.

A report from The Daily Caller sheds light on the Clinton Foundation's financial allocations, particularly in the year 2014. According to the report, a mere 5.7% of the foundation's budget that year was directed toward charitable grants, raising questions about its operational priorities. The foundation's total expenditures for 2014 reached nearly $91.3 million, yet only about $5.2 million was allocated to charitable causes. This stark contrast prompts a reevaluation of the foundation's role in philanthropy.

The breakdown of the foundation's spending reveals an alarming trend. In 2014, the foundation allocated $34.8 million for salaries, compensation, and employee benefits, while an additional $50.4 million was spent on ""other expenses."" This significant investment in administrative costs raises concerns about the foundation's commitment to its charitable objectives. Furthermore, charitable spending saw a drastic decline of 40% from 2013 to 2014, despite the foundation experiencing an increase of $30 million in revenue during the same period.

Interestingly, the foundation's spending on salaries and other expenses surged by $5 million in 2014, suggesting a shift in focus away from charitable endeavors. Critics argue that these financial decisions indicate a prioritization of personal and organizational gain over genuine philanthropic efforts. The author of the report posits that the foundation has primarily served as a vehicle for the Clintons to amass wealth, particularly leveraging Hillary's position as Secretary of State for financial advantage.

As the narrative unfolds, the implications of these findings are profound. The Clinton Foundation, once heralded as a beacon of charitable work, now faces scrutiny regarding its financial integrity and operational transparency. The allegations of pay-to-play corruption are not merely political fodder but raise fundamental questions about the ethics of charitable organizations and the responsibilities of their leaders. As investigations continue, the public remains watchful, seeking clarity on the true nature of the Clinton Foundation's activities and their impact on the Clintons' legacy.",25.0,17.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,454.0,0.9444444444444444,0.037444933920704845

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In a speech delivered in New York City, former President Barack Obama has sparked outrage among many Americans, particularly in light of recent violent incidents that have shaken the nation. The speech, which took place shortly after a series of bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing in St. Cloud, Minnesota, has drawn sharp criticism for its perceived insensitivity and lack of acknowledgment of these tragic events.

Critics have described Obama’s remarks as tone-deaf and arrogant, suggesting that he failed to address the gravity of the situation affecting the nation. Instead of focusing on the violence that has left many injured and communities in turmoil, Obama chose to deliver his speech at a high-dollar fundraiser, which many see as a misstep given the context of the recent attacks.

During his address, Obama shifted the focus to issues of sexism in the media, offering pointed criticism of Donald Trump while lauding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. His comments, while politically charged, did not include any mention of the injured victims from the bombings or the stabbing incident. This omission has left many feeling that he missed a crucial opportunity to express solidarity with those affected by the violence.

The backlash against Obama’s speech has been swift. Numerous commentators and political analysts have voiced their disappointment, arguing that a brief acknowledgment of the attacks would have demonstrated compassion and leadership in a time of crisis. Critics contend that the former president’s decision to prioritize political fundraising over addressing national security concerns reveals a disconnect from the realities facing Americans.

In the wake of the bombings and the stabbing, many citizens expected a leader to respond with empathy and assurance. Instead, Obama’s focus on political rhetoric has only intensified feelings of outrage among those who believe that he should have recognized the severity of the situation. The failure to mention the victims or to provide any words of comfort has led to a growing sentiment that his priorities may be misplaced.

The incidents in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota have raised serious concerns about safety and security in the United States, making Obama’s choice to sidestep these issues all the more contentious. As violence continues to impact communities, many Americans are calling for leaders to take a stand and address the fears and concerns of their constituents.

The article reflects a broader frustration with political figures who seem to prioritize fundraising and personal agendas over the urgent needs of the public. In times of crisis, citizens look to their leaders for guidance and support, and the lack of acknowledgment from Obama has left many feeling abandoned in their time of need.

As the nation continues to grapple with the aftermath of these violent events, the call for accountability and responsiveness from public figures remains strong. Critics are urging leaders to prioritize the safety and well-being of citizens, especially in moments of crisis, rather than focusing solely on political gain.

In conclusion, Obama’s recent speech has ignited a firestorm of criticism for its perceived insensitivity to the violence that has recently occurred in the nation. The expectation for leaders to respond with compassion and acknowledgment during such troubling times is paramount, and many are left wondering if this expectation will be met in the future. As the nation seeks healing and unity, the importance of responsive leadership cannot be overstated.",-25.0,-66.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,640.0,-2.869565217391304,-0.103125
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

The Clinton Foundation is facing intensified scrutiny following a new report that highlights serious issues related to its operations, particularly concerning the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI). Since Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, public awareness of corruption allegations surrounding the foundation has grown, and the latest findings may exacerbate concerns.

According to a report by The Daily Caller, CHAI has been implicated in distributing ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa. This alarming revelation comes from a draft congressional report, which suggests that the distribution of these diluted drugs may have increased morbidity and mortality risks for patients relying on this critical treatment.

CHAI is recognized as one of the Clinton Foundation's most significant initiatives, aimed at improving health outcomes in developing regions. However, the implications of this report could lead to heightened scrutiny of the foundation, especially as Hillary Clinton embarks on her presidential campaign. The timing raises questions about the foundation's practices and its commitment to patient safety.

Further complicating the situation, the congressional study reveals connections between Bill Clinton and two controversial Indian-Americans associated with Ranbaxy, a pharmaceutical company previously embroiled in scandals related to poor quality control and fraudulent practices. These ties could further tarnish the foundation's reputation and raise alarms about the integrity of its health initiatives.

Uncertainty persists regarding the exact number of AIDS patients who may have received the adulterated drugs, leaving many advocates and health professionals concerned about the potential consequences of these practices. In light of the troubling findings, there have been calls for the immediate shutdown of the Clinton Foundation to prevent any further harm to vulnerable populations.

As the situation unfolds, the foundation's future and its impact on public health initiatives remain uncertain, with critics demanding accountability and transparency from one of the world's most prominent charitable organizations.",-14.0,-21.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,352.0,-1.75,-0.05965909090909091
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all.

The Arizona state legislature is under fire for the introduction of poorly worded bills that have unintentionally criminalized common parenting activities, raising significant concerns among residents and legal experts alike. One law, in particular, has drawn scrutiny for its vague language, which criminalizes any contact between an adult and a child's genitals, thereby putting parents at risk of felony charges for actions as routine as diaper changing or bathing.

Originally designed to protect children from molesters, the law has been criticized for its lack of effective legislative language, leading to fears that innocent parents could find themselves facing serious legal repercussions for simply caring for their children. The implications of such a law have led to widespread concern about the potential for misinterpretation and misuse by law enforcement.

In a recent ruling, the Arizona Supreme Court noted that prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents for innocent conduct. However, this ruling has raised alarms about the burden placed on defendants, who may now be required to prove a lack of sexual intent in cases where their actions are misinterpreted. Critics argue that this requirement undermines the fundamental legal principle of ""innocent until proven guilty,"" which is a cornerstone of the American justice system.

Further complicating matters is the issue of plea bargaining, where defendants may feel pressured to admit guilt to avoid facing harsher charges. This scenario poses a significant risk for parents who may be coerced into accepting plea deals, potentially leading to wrongful admissions of guilt and violations of constitutional rights. The very framework intended to protect children could inadvertently become a tool for coercion against innocent parents.

The fallout from this legal ambiguity has resulted in many Arizona residents becoming unknowing criminals, as the vague language of the law leaves room for interpretation that could easily ensnare well-meaning caregivers. The suspension of due process for parents and caregivers has raised alarms about the broader implications for family rights and the protection of innocent individuals within the state.

As the debate continues, skepticism has emerged regarding the government's ability to effectively address these issues. Many residents are questioning whether lawmakers can be trusted to rectify the unintended consequences of their legislation. The situation has sparked a larger conversation about the need for clarity and precision in drafting laws that impact the lives of families, particularly when it comes to sensitive subjects such as child protection.

The Arizona state legislature now faces mounting pressure to reevaluate its approach to child protection laws and to ensure that future legislation does not inadvertently criminalize normal parenting activities. As the community grapples with the ramifications of these poorly worded bills, the call for a more thoughtful and deliberate legislative process has never been more urgent. Parents and caregivers across Arizona are left to navigate a legal landscape that, while intended to safeguard children, has instead cast a shadow of uncertainty over their everyday lives.",-12.0,-43.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,536.0,-2.388888888888889,-0.08022388059701492

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one.

As the political landscape shifts with the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency, questions are emerging about the continuing coverage and influence of the Obamas, particularly Michelle Obama. With Clinton's potential return to the White House, there is growing concern over how the former First Lady and her initiatives might be positioned within a new administration.

Michelle Obama has garnered significant attention for her legacy, especially through her initiatives aimed at improving the health and well-being of children across the nation. Her signature school lunch program, which sought to provide healthier food options in schools, has been both praised and scrutinized. As discussions about her legacy unfold, many are left wondering how her advocacy for children's health will fare in a Clinton administration, particularly as Clinton herself has expressed strong beliefs about the government's role in child-rearing.

However, with speculation surrounding Michelle Obama's qualifications for a new role in a potential Clinton administration, some are questioning whether her experience aligns with the demands of a formal political position. While her activism has resonated with many, the transition from First Lady to a more defined role in government raises eyebrows about the extent of her capabilities in a political capacity.

In light of this, it appears that Michelle Obama is determined to continue her campaign for healthy living for children indefinitely, regardless of the political climate. Her commitment to this cause suggests that she may remain a prominent figure in discussions about public health and nutrition, particularly as the nation grapples with rising obesity rates and related health concerns among youth.

Moreover, Clinton's strategy may be to appeal to voters who harbor fondness for the Obamas, even if they have reservations about her leadership. This maneuvering could be seen as an attempt to bridge the gap between her own political identity and the legacy of the Obamas, who have maintained a strong connection with many Americans. As Clinton navigates her campaign, the integration of the Obamas' ideals may serve as a tactical advantage in garnering support from a diverse voter base.

Nevertheless, underlying this political calculus is a growing discomfort among some segments of the population regarding progressive control over education and parenting by the government. Critics argue that an increased government influence in these areas could undermine parental rights and individual freedoms. This sentiment complicates the narrative surrounding Michelle Obama’s initiatives, as her focus on health and nutrition for children intersects with broader debates about the role of government in personal and family matters.

As the election approaches, the dynamic between the Obamas and a potential Clinton administration will likely continue to evolve. The interplay of Michelle Obama's legacy, her ongoing advocacy, and Clinton's political strategies will shape the discourse surrounding both figures. With the Obamas' influence still palpable in American society, their relationship with Clinton could prove pivotal in defining the political landscape of the future.

In conclusion, as speculation mounts about the role of the Obamas in a potential Clinton presidency, the conversation encompasses a wide range of issues, from Michelle Obama's legacy to the implications of government involvement in parenting. As both women navigate their respective paths, the intertwining of their narratives will undoubtedly continue to captivate the public's attention, raising essential questions about leadership, legacy, and the future of American policy.",6.0,28.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,626.0,1.4,0.04472843450479233

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A new scandal has emerged surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), raising serious allegations regarding the distribution of ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa. The revelations have sparked outrage and concern among health advocates and patients alike, as the diluted medications reportedly increased risks of morbidity and mortality, leading to numerous deaths across the region.

The controversy centers on Indian drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, which has been implicated in the scandal. Ranbaxy was previously found guilty in 2013 of multiple counts related to drug adulteration and fraud, culminating in a staggering $500 million fine. The company’s history of questionable practices has now resurfaced, prompting renewed scrutiny of its relationship with CHAI and the implications for patients relying on its medications.

In a congressional report initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, critical questions have arisen regarding the Clintons' awareness of Ranbaxy's actions and their ties to the company. Blackburn has emphasized the dire consequences of distributing substandard drugs, questioning how many lives were lost due to what she characterized as false promises made in the name of humanitarian aid. The report suggests that the Clintons may have overlooked significant warning signs about the quality of drugs being provided to vulnerable populations.

The Clinton Foundation, which has been a prominent advocate for global health initiatives, is under fire for its promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence of the company's poor quality control and fraudulent reporting practices to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This troubling relationship raises critical ethical questions about the foundation's commitment to patient safety and the integrity of its health programs.

In 2007, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy, funding that has since raised alarms regarding the quality of HIV medicines distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. Reports have emerged indicating that patients receiving these watered-down drugs may have faced increased health risks, leading to a surge in morbidity and mortality rates among those dependent on these treatments.

Despite being banned from the U.S. market, Ranbaxy's generic drugs continue to be sold worldwide, a situation that further complicates the narrative surrounding the Clinton Foundation's involvement. The foundation's ongoing ties to the company have prompted allegations of widespread corruption, suggesting that financial gain may have taken precedence over genuine humanitarian concerns.

As the scandal unfolds, health experts and advocacy groups are calling for greater transparency and accountability from the Clinton Foundation and CHAI. The implications of distributing substandard medicines in regions already grappling with the HIV/AIDS epidemic are profound, and the potential loss of life due to these actions is a sobering reality that cannot be ignored.

The fallout from this scandal could have far-reaching consequences for the Clinton Foundation and its future endeavors in global health. With increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and the public, the foundation may face significant challenges in maintaining its credibility and trust among stakeholders. 

Rep. Blackburn's report has amplified calls for an independent investigation into the practices of both Ranbaxy and the Clinton Foundation. Advocates argue that a thorough examination is essential to ensure that patients receive the quality care they deserve and that organizations operating in the global health space are held to the highest standards of accountability.

As the investigation progresses, the spotlight remains firmly on the Clintons and their legacy in global health initiatives. The potential loss of life attributed to the distribution of diluted drugs raises ethical questions about the responsibilities of organizations that claim to prioritize humanitarian efforts. The need for rigorous oversight in the pharmaceutical industry has never been more apparent, particularly in regions where access to quality healthcare is already limited.

The implications of the scandal extend beyond the immediate health concerns, as it also highlights the intricate web of relationships between pharmaceutical companies, non-profit organizations, and government agencies. With billions of dollars at stake in global health funding, the potential for conflicts of interest and corruption cannot be overlooked.

In conclusion, the allegations surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and Ranbaxy serve as a stark reminder of the complexities involved in addressing global health challenges. As the investigation unfolds, the need for accountability and transparency in the distribution of life-saving medications remains a priority for advocates and patients alike. The question of how many lives were affected by these practices lingers, underscoring the urgent need for reform and vigilance in the fight against HIV/AIDS.",-63.0,-40.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,815.0,-1.4285714285714286,-0.049079754601226995

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

In a significant ruling, a federal judge has mandated that the State Department release documents concerning the security training of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her aides within five days. The order was issued by Judge Richard Leon, who ruled in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF) in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit aimed at uncovering the details of security briefings related to the handling of classified materials and secure communications.

The ruling comes amid ongoing scrutiny of the State Department's handling of FOIA requests, particularly those connected to Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. Judge Leon rejected the State Department's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, a move that underscores the court's commitment to transparency and accountability in government operations. However, he did deny TheDCNF's request to depose State Department officials, a decision that may limit the scope of the investigation into the matter.

At the core of TheDCNF's lawsuit is the contention that the State Department has failed to provide records confirming whether Clinton and her aides received mandatory security briefings. The organization is specifically seeking documentation related to Clinton, her Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin, and Advisor Jacob Sullivan. The absence of such records has raised questions about compliance with security protocols during Clinton's time in office.

Judge Leon expressed his frustration with the State Department's delays in producing the requested documents. In his ruling, he ordered the release of one-third of the requested materials by September 26 and the remainder by October 10. This timeline aims to ensure that the public has access to critical information regarding the security training of key officials during a pivotal era in U.S. foreign policy.

An attorney representing TheDCNF emphasized that the judge's order highlights a pattern of ongoing obstruction from the State Department regarding the FOIA process. The attorney argued that the lack of transparency surrounding Clinton's security training not only raises concerns about compliance with federal regulations but also about the overall accountability of government officials.

State Department officials have acknowledged that their failure to produce the requested documents suggests that Clinton and her aides may not have completed the required security courses. This admission has intensified scrutiny on the practices and protocols that were in place during Clinton's tenure, particularly in relation to the handling of classified information.

The ruling marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate over the transparency of government operations and the importance of adhering to established protocols for handling sensitive information. As the State Department prepares to comply with the court's order, the release of these documents is expected to shed light on the security measures that were—or were not—taken by Clinton and her team.

The implications of this ruling extend beyond the immediate context of Clinton's security training. It raises broader questions about the accountability of government officials and the mechanisms in place to ensure that they adhere to the highest standards of security and transparency. As the public awaits the release of the documents, the case serves as a reminder of the importance of oversight in government operations and the need for transparency in the handling of classified materials.

In the wake of the judge's ruling, TheDCNF and other watchdog organizations are likely to continue their efforts to hold the State Department accountable for its handling of FOIA requests. The outcome of this case may set a precedent for future requests and could influence how government agencies respond to inquiries about sensitive information.

As the deadline for the release of the documents approaches, all eyes will be on the State Department to see how it navigates the court's order. The forthcoming release could provide critical insights into the security training of one of the most prominent figures in American politics and further illuminate the complexities surrounding the management of classified information within the U.S. government.

In conclusion, the federal judge's order to release documents related to Hillary Clinton and her aides' security training marks a significant development in the ongoing discourse surrounding government transparency and accountability. With the deadline set for the release of the documents, the public eagerly anticipates the insights that will emerge from this landmark ruling.",-5.0,0.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,779.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

As the first presidential debate approaches, the role of moderator Lester Holt is under scrutiny, particularly regarding the absence of real-time fact-checking during the event. Reports indicate that Holt is unlikely to challenge candidates on the accuracy of their statements, a decision that raises significant concerns about accountability in the political discourse.

This lack of oversight could provide Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, with a platform to make unverified claims without facing immediate scrutiny. While Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, may challenge Trump on certain points, the overall responsibility for holding candidates accountable rests heavily on Holt's shoulders. The stakes are high, as Politico highlights that Trump has been known to make false statements approximately every three-and-a-half minutes. This alarming frequency underscores the critical need for a robust fact-checking process during the debates.

Major cable news networks, including Univision and Telemundo, have announced that they will not provide on-screen fact checks during the debate. This decision aligns with a broader trend in media, where the reluctance to fact-check stems from concerns over viewer ratings. As networks prioritize audience engagement, the integrity of the information presented during such pivotal events may be compromised.

Clinton's campaign has voiced strong concerns over this dynamic, emphasizing the necessity for Holt to call out falsehoods in real time. The campaign argues that without immediate fact-checking, the debate could skew in favor of Trump, who has been able to dominate narratives with unchecked statements. This creates a challenging environment for Clinton, who faces a double standard in the eyes of the electorate. She must perform exceptionally well to counteract the impact of Trump's unverified claims, which may resonate more strongly with viewers unaccustomed to real-time corrections.

The implications of this debate format extend beyond the candidates themselves, raising broader questions about the state of journalism in the context of the election. The media’s role as a watchdog is critical, and the decision to forgo fact-checking could set a concerning precedent for future political discourse. As viewers tune in, the expectation for transparency and accountability in political debates remains paramount.

In summary, the upcoming presidential debate features a significant gap in the fact-checking process, which could allow candidates, particularly Trump, to make misleading statements without immediate repercussions. As the responsibility for accountability falls primarily on Holt, the effectiveness of the debate as a platform for informed voter decision-making is at stake. The outcome of this debate may not only influence the election but also reflect the evolving landscape of political journalism in America.",-6.0,5.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,480.0,0.2631578947368421,0.010416666666666666
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

Dolly Kyle, a longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton, has voiced significant concerns regarding Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency. In a recent statement, Kyle characterized Clinton as being driven by ""anger and rage,"" suggesting that these emotions could lead to potential physical breakdowns. This assertion raises questions about Clinton's overall health and her capacity to manage the pressures of the highest office in the land.

Kyle's critique extends beyond emotional concerns; she claims that Clinton is grappling with cognitive impairment, emotional instability, and memory loss. Additionally, she highlights difficulties in task execution, which could severely impact a leader's effectiveness. Such allegations are particularly alarming as they suggest that Clinton may not be operating at her full capacity, raising doubts about her ability to fulfill presidential duties.

Moreover, Kyle describes Clinton's paranoia and controlling nature as detrimental traits for someone seeking the presidency. These characteristics, according to Kyle, could hinder effective leadership and decision-making, qualities that are essential for a successful presidency. The implications of such behavior could resonate negatively with voters who prioritize stability and rationality in their leaders.

In an effort to shed light on these troubling aspects of Clinton's health and character, Kyle authored a book titled ""Hillary the Other Woman."" This work aims to provide insight into what she perceives as serious issues that could affect Clinton's candidacy. By bringing these concerns to the forefront, Kyle seeks to inform the public about the potential risks associated with electing Clinton as president.

Kyle goes further to assert that Clinton's obsession with power may lead her to jeopardize both her health and the broader interests of the Democratic Party. This addiction to power, according to Kyle, could have far-reaching consequences not only for Clinton herself but also for the party's future and unity. As the political landscape continues to evolve, such criticisms could pose significant challenges for Clinton in maintaining a positive public image.

As these concerns gain attention, they add to the myriad challenges Hillary Clinton faces amid ongoing scrutiny regarding her health and character. The intersection of personal attributes and political ambition raises critical questions about the qualifications necessary for presidential leadership. As voters prepare for the upcoming election, Kyle's revelations could influence public perception and ultimately impact Clinton's candidacy.",-13.0,5.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,445.0,0.2777777777777778,0.011235955056179775

” MUSLIMS MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST ADAPT TO CANADA, ITS CUSTOMS, ITS TRADITIONS, ITS WAY OF LIFE, BECAUSE IT WAS THE COUNTRY THAT WAS CHOSEN TO EMIGRATE. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT THEY MUST INTEGRATE AND LEARN TO LIVE IN CANADA.

WE ACCEPT MANY IMMIGRANTS, IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT CULTURES AND RELIGIONS, CONTRADICTING TO MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT ACCEPT IMMIGRANTS NON-MUSLIMS. FOR THIS REASON, THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE. FINALLY, THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN CANADA, WITH ITS JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ROOTS, CHRISTMAS TREES, CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS, RELIGION MUST REMAIN IN THE PRIVATE SPHERE. THE MUNICIPALITY OF DURVAL HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY CONCESSIONS TO ISLAM AND SHARIA LAW. FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

As discussions surrounding immigration continue to dominate the political landscape in both the United States and Canada, a recurring theme has emerged: the necessity for unity among diverse populations. While America prides itself on being a ""nation of immigrants,"" there is a growing sentiment that newcomers should prioritize integration into the established cultural framework rather than maintain separate cultural programs.

Critics argue that some immigrants, particularly from Muslim backgrounds, exhibit a desire to preserve their distinct cultural practices, which can lead to tensions within the broader society. The mayor of Quebec has been particularly vocal on this matter, asserting that immigrants must adapt to Canadian customs and traditions. This perspective emphasizes the importance of cultural assimilation as a pathway to fostering a cohesive society.

In Canada, there is a strong assertion that the nation is not inherently racist or xenophobic. Citizens express a willingness to accept diverse cultures; however, this acceptance comes with the expectation that newcomers will embrace the Canadian identity. Discussions highlight the significance of maintaining Canadian cultural roots, including its Judeo-Christian heritage, which many believe should be preserved in the face of changing demographics.

The municipality of Dorval has taken a firm stance on this issue, asserting its right to refuse concessions to Islamic practices and Sharia law. This local governance decision underscores a broader sentiment that if immigrants do not align with Canadian cultural values, they may be better suited to return to their countries of origin. This suggestion, while controversial, reflects the belief that cultural integration is paramount for the stability and identity of the nation.

In the United States, similar sentiments are echoed, particularly in Texas, where legislative actions are being taken to prevent the implementation of Sharia law within the American judicial system. This proactive approach aims to safeguard the existing cultural framework and prevent any potential encroachment on American customs and legal practices.

The debate extends to everyday practices, such as dietary restrictions, where there is a growing concern that these should not impose on the majority’s cultural norms. Advocates for integration argue that immigrants should adapt to the customs of the host country rather than attempt to alter them. This perspective calls for a balance where newcomers respect and adhere to the established traditions, ensuring that their presence enriches rather than disrupts the cultural landscape.

The overarching stance in both Canada and the United States is clear: immigrants are encouraged to integrate into their new societies or consider returning to their countries of origin if they find the established customs incompatible with their beliefs. This sentiment reflects a desire for a harmonious coexistence where cultural diversity is celebrated, but not at the expense of the foundational values that define the nation.

As the discourse around immigration and cultural integration continues, it remains essential for both policymakers and communities to navigate these complex issues with sensitivity and a commitment to unity. The challenge lies in fostering an environment where diverse cultures can thrive while simultaneously honoring the historical and cultural legacies that have shaped these nations.

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a surprising turn of events in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by a group of Black Lives Matter protesters while driving through a demonstration. Eyewitnesses at the scene were initially apprehensive, fearing that the man might be mugged as he navigated through the gathering crowd.

However, the situation took a dramatic twist when the driver brandished a handgun out of his window. This unexpected display of firepower quickly altered the dynamics of the protest. Witnesses reported that the protesters, upon seeing the firearm, rapidly dispersed, allowing the man to continue on his way without further incident.

This incident has raised questions about how individuals should handle potentially volatile situations when confronted by large groups during protests. While the driver’s choice to display a weapon effectively cleared the way for him, experts caution against such actions, noting that brandishing a firearm can escalate tensions and lead to dangerous outcomes.

Various options exist for individuals who find themselves in similar predicaments. Locking car doors is a common safety measure that can provide a sense of security in uncertain situations. Additionally, calling the police can be a prudent course of action, allowing law enforcement to manage the situation and ensure the safety of all involved.

Another option some might consider is simply driving through the crowd, though this approach carries its own risks. It is essential to assess the situation carefully, as attempting to push through a protest can provoke anger and lead to further complications.

As discussions continue regarding the best practices for navigating protests, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of public demonstrations. The response of the Black Lives Matter protesters, coupled with the man’s choice to brandish a firearm, highlights the complexities and potential dangers inherent in such encounters.

While the driver emerged unscathed, the implications of his actions and the reactions of the crowd underscore the importance of finding peaceful and constructive ways to engage with social movements, rather than resorting to aggression or fear.",-18.0,-16.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,382.0,-1.0666666666666667,-0.041884816753926704

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Chicago environmentalists are under fire for what critics describe as hypocrisy regarding their inconsistent stances on local development projects. The group, which previously opposed filmmaker George Lucas's proposal to build a museum in the city, is now expressing support for the construction of the Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park.

Juanita Irizarry, the executive director of Friends of the Parks, voiced her enthusiasm for the Obama center, highlighting its significance to the community. However, the construction of the center raises concerns as it involves the bulldozing of trees and grass, a stark contrast to Lucas's project that would have utilized an existing parking lot.

This apparent double standard has led to discussions about the underlying motives behind these environmental decisions. Critics suggest a racial dimension to the controversy, framing the dilemma as one that pits support for a project honoring a Black figure against opposition to a project associated with a white figure. 

The situation has prompted a broader examination of the principles guiding Chicago's environmentalists. The author of a recent critique argues that the organization is contradicting its own charter and exhibiting a political bias that undermines its credibility. As the debate continues, the environmentalists' actions are prompting questions about equity and consistency in urban development policies.

As the city moves forward with the Obama Presidential Center, the scrutiny of environmentalists' decisions serves as a reminder of the complexities involved in balancing community interests, historical significance, and environmental stewardship.",3.0,-9.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,280.0,-0.9,-0.03214285714285714

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

General Stanley McChrystal, the former Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, has officially submitted his resignation following escalating tensions with President Barack Obama over the conduct of the war. Known for his candid approach, McChrystal often found himself at odds with the President, leading to a strained relationship that culminated in a pivotal meeting in the Oval Office.

During this critical encounter, McChrystal entered with the expectation that his military career was nearing its end. President Obama confronted him, accusing the General of failing to provide political support. In a measured response, McChrystal clarified that his commitment was to uphold his duty as Commander-in-Chief, rather than to engage in political maneuvering.

In a decisive moment, McChrystal handed his resignation to Obama, a move that the President received with dissatisfaction. Reports indicate that Obama made a disparaging remark regarding McChrystal's feelings post-resignation, which underscored the contentious nature of their relationship.

Despite the circumstances, McChrystal maintained his composure, saluting the President and asserting that he would not ""stand in line"" after his departure from the Army. This statement reflects the General's unwavering principles and dedication to his role, even in the face of personal and professional turmoil.

As the military community and the nation reflect on McChrystal's career, his honor and integrity stand out as defining traits.

Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm. Shut up. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down.

In the wake of recent unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, alarming revelations have surfaced regarding the identities of those involved in the riots. Reports indicate that at least 70% of the rioters possessed out-of-state identification, raising questions about the motivations behind the chaos that unfolded in the city. The head of the local police union has gone so far as to label these individuals as ""professional criminals"" who were brought in specifically to incite violence.

The situation in Charlotte has drawn attention to the potential exploitation of the Black Lives Matter movement by organized groups. There are claims that these groups are using the movement as a cover to advance their own agendas, instigating violence and unrest in the process. This perspective has sparked a heated debate about the integrity of the protests and the intentions of those who participate in them.

In contrast, the city of Tulsa has recently faced its own set of challenges related to protests. Reports indicated that similar busing of protesters was anticipated, yet the situation in Tulsa remained largely peaceful. This stark difference in outcomes between the two cities has led to speculation about the effectiveness of the strategies employed by those seeking to create unrest. While the unrest in Charlotte appeared to serve the goals of the orchestrators, the lack of significant turmoil in Tulsa suggests that their efforts were less successful there.

CNN's coverage of the Charlotte riots emphasized that the majority of individuals involved were not part of the local community. Instead, they were characterized as criminals rather than genuine protesters advocating for social justice. This characterization has fueled a narrative that questions the authenticity of the protests and the motivations of those who participated in them.

The author of this article posits that the situation in Tulsa diffused largely due to a lack of sympathy for the Black Lives Matter movement among the local populace. Additionally, the recent charging of a police officer involved in a controversial shooting may have further contributed to the peaceful atmosphere. In contrast, the environment in Charlotte was ripe for chaos, suggesting that the instigators of the violence were able to exploit existing tensions to their advantage.

Underlying these events is a narrative that suggests the instigators are not merely interested in advocating for change but are instead seeking to create chaos and racial conflict as part of a larger revolutionary agenda. This perspective raises critical questions about the motivations of those who participate in protests and the potential for manipulation by organized groups.

As the nation continues to grapple with issues of race and justice, the events in Charlotte and Tulsa serve as a reminder of the complexities surrounding social movements. The contrasting responses to protests in these two cities highlight the varying degrees of community engagement and the potential for outside influence to shape local narratives.

The implications of these events extend beyond the immediate unrest, prompting a broader examination of how social movements can be co-opted for purposes that diverge from their original intentions. As discussions surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement evolve, it remains essential to critically assess the dynamics at play and the forces that may seek to exploit them for their own gain.

In conclusion, the situation in Charlotte has raised significant concerns about the presence of out-of-state rioters and the potential manipulation of social movements by organized groups. As communities continue to navigate the challenges of protest and activism, the lessons learned from these events will undoubtedly shape the future of social justice efforts across the nation.",-17.0,-23.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,646.0,-0.9583333333333334,-0.03560371517027864

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!

Hillary Clinton's health has emerged as a pivotal issue in the ongoing Presidential campaign, with concerns that were once dismissed as mere “conspiracy theories” now gaining traction among the American public. Following her collapse on September 11th, even media outlets that have traditionally supported her can no longer overlook the implications of her health problems.

Expert Clif Hite has put forth a startling theory suggesting that Clinton may have died and been replaced by body doubles and CGI images. If substantiated, this would represent one of the most significant coverups in American political history.

Allegations have surfaced that she never left her daughter Chelsea's apartment and was allegedly involved in a secret plane crash that resulted in serious injuries.

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right?

In a recent revelation, Discover the Networks has identified 187 groups funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros, many of which are targeting presidential candidates who oppose their progressive values. Among these organizations is the newly established Common Defense PAC, which has emerged as a vocal opponent of former President Donald Trump.

Common Defense PAC positions itself as an advocate for the rights of American veterans, claiming to defend their interests against the Trump administration. However, the organization's activities and affiliations have raised eyebrows, particularly regarding its funding sources and leadership structure.

The leadership page of Common Defense PAC features a list of military veterans; however, it conspicuously lacks contact information for these individuals. This absence of transparency has led to questions about the authenticity of their claims to represent veterans' interests. Additionally, the organization's social media presence is heavily laden with anti-Trump content, further solidifying its stance against the former president.

One of the more notable actions taken by Common Defense PAC includes the sharing of an anti-Trump video advertisement linked to a petition on MoveOn.org. This petition specifically calls on Senator Rob Portman to disavow Trump, highlighting the PAC's strategic efforts to influence political figures and public opinion against the former president. The campaign has been amplified by the use of the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which has garnered support from MoveOn.org, a well-known progressive political action committee.

MoveOn.org has not only endorsed the hashtag but has also actively promoted it through its Political Action platform. The collaboration between Common Defense PAC and MoveOn.org has proven effective, as evidenced by a Thunderclap campaign titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump, which reportedly reached over 4.5 million people. This campaign underscores the extensive reach of these organizations and their commitment to mobilizing public sentiment against Trump.

In terms of financial backing, Common Defense PAC's July Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing reveals a surprising lack of donor diversity. The document lists only one contributor, Marjorie Roswell, who donated $20,000. This singular source of funding raises questions about the organization's financial independence and its ability to genuinely represent the interests of a broader veteran community.

Perry O’Brien, the director of Common Defense PAC, is a figure of particular interest. Described as a left-wing activist and conscientious objector, O’Brien has a history of anti-war activism that aligns with the organization's progressive agenda. His leadership and the PAC's composition have prompted skepticism regarding its representation of veterans. Critics argue that the organization is primarily driven by a singular ideological perspective, which may not accurately reflect the diverse views held by the veteran community.

The emergence of Common Defense PAC as a Soros-funded entity dedicated to opposing Trump highlights the growing influence of external financial support in American politics. The strategic alignment with MoveOn.org and the focus on anti-Trump messaging suggest a concerted effort to sway public opinion and political discourse in a direction favorable to progressive values.

As the 2024 presidential election approaches, the activities of Common Defense PAC will likely continue to attract attention. The organization's commitment to promoting its anti-Trump agenda, coupled with its ties to influential funding sources, positions it as a significant player in the political landscape. However, the questions surrounding its leadership and representation of veterans may hinder its credibility among the very group it claims to advocate for.

In conclusion, Common Defense PAC exemplifies the intersection of funding, activism, and political strategy in contemporary American politics. The organization's efforts to mobilize veterans against Trump, while backed by Soros and aligned with MoveOn.org, reflect a broader trend of leveraging financial resources to influence electoral outcomes. As the political climate evolves, the impact of such organizations on the discourse surrounding veteran rights and presidential candidates will remain a focal point of analysis and debate.",8.0,27.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,717.0,0.9642857142857143,0.03765690376569038

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

A recent investigation by CBS News has brought to light a controversial decision made by the Obama State Department to allocate a staggering $770 million in taxpayer funds for the renovation of mosques overseas. This revelation, initially reported back in 2015, has resurfaced, reigniting discussions about the implications of U.S. foreign aid and its impact on domestic and international relations.

The allocation of such a significant sum for religious structures has raised eyebrows among critics, who argue that funding overseas mosques could inadvertently support organizations with potential ties to terrorism. This concern is particularly poignant given the ongoing global fight against extremism and the complexities surrounding U.S. foreign policy in predominantly Muslim countries.

Taxpayer advocates have expressed their outrage over the expenditure of taxpayer dollars on religious buildings, especially at a time when the United States is grappling with substantial economic challenges, including persistently high unemployment rates. Jared Thomas, a prominent taxpayer advocate, voiced his discontent, emphasizing that the funds are being spent on what he described as a ""gigantic credit card"" while many American citizens continue to struggle financially.

The State Department, however, has defended its decision, asserting that the funding is part of broader efforts to foster relationships with Islamic leaders in order to combat extremism. Officials argue that by renovating mosques and supporting local religious institutions, the U.S. can create a foundation for dialogue and cooperation that may ultimately contribute to global stability.

Despite the State Department's rationale, the allocation of funds for religious structures overseas raises critical questions about the priorities of U.S. foreign aid. Critics contend that such spending could be perceived as a misallocation of resources, particularly when domestic issues require urgent attention. The juxtaposition of foreign aid directed at religious institutions against the backdrop of economic hardship in the U.S. has sparked a debate about the appropriate use of taxpayer money.

Furthermore, the investigation has also brought to light concerns surrounding the implications of bringing in Muslim refugees and the potential impact on the voting demographic within the United States. As discussions around immigration and refugee policies continue to evolve, the intersection of these policies with foreign aid expenditures adds another layer of complexity to the national dialogue.

The resurfacing of this story has prompted renewed scrutiny of the Obama administration's foreign aid policies, particularly regarding the allocation of funds to religious institutions. As the nation grapples with the fallout from economic challenges and shifting demographics, the implications of such spending decisions remain a contentious topic among policymakers and the public alike.

In light of the investigation, calls for greater transparency and accountability in foreign aid spending are likely to intensify. Advocates for fiscal responsibility are urging lawmakers to reassess the allocation of taxpayer dollars, ensuring that funds are directed toward initiatives that directly benefit American citizens and address pressing domestic needs.

As the debate continues, the CBS News investigation serves as a reminder of the complexities inherent in U.S. foreign aid policies and the need for a careful examination of how taxpayer money is utilized on the global stage. With economic uncertainty looming and public sentiment shifting, the implications of funding overseas mosque renovations will likely remain a focal point of discussion for both critics and supporters of U.S. foreign aid initiatives. 

The evolving narrative surrounding this issue underscores the importance of balancing international engagement with the needs and concerns of American citizens, as the nation navigates the intricate landscape of foreign relations and domestic priorities.",-13.0,1.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,639.0,0.05,0.001564945226917058

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

This fearless attitude underscores the Marines' commitment to national security and their readiness to engage with those who threaten the safety of Americans.

The timing of the billboard campaign is particularly poignant, coming on the heels of a troubling year marked by a series of terrorist attacks across the United States. The Marines aim to reassure the public of their unwavering dedication to protecting the nation, while simultaneously challenging the narrative of fear propagated by terrorist organizations. 

The billboards serve as a powerful symbol of resilience, representing a refusal to succumb to the intimidation tactics employed by terrorists. By boldly declaring that they are not afraid, the Marines are directly challenging the agenda of groups like ISIS, which thrive on creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. The message is clear: if Americans collectively refuse to be afraid, the terrorists ultimately lose their power.

However, the initiative has not been without controversy. The campaign has sparked significant backlash among some liberal factions, who are perceived to prioritize a more conciliatory approach to terrorism. Critics argue that the Marines' display of strength may escalate tensions rather than foster dialogue. This divide highlights the ongoing debate within the country regarding the best strategies for dealing with the persistent threat of terrorism.

Despite the criticism, the Marines remain steadfast in their mission. The billboards are a testament to their readiness to protect the nation and confront those who wish to do harm. As the campaign rolls out, it serves as a reminder of the importance of resilience in the face of adversity and the necessity of a strong defense against those who seek to instill fear in society.

In a world where terrorism continues to pose a significant threat, the Marines’ message is clear: they stand prepared to meet the challenge, and they urge Americans to stand firm alongside them. The fight against fear and intimidation is not just a military endeavor; it is a collective call to maintain courage in the face of adversity.",-53.0,-24.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,496.0,-1.2,-0.04838709677419355

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, is reeling from a wave of rioting that has severely disrupted the city, resulting in widespread looting and violence. In response to the escalating chaos, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has declared a state of emergency and mobilized the National Guard to restore order.

The unrest has prompted local officials to take a firm stance against those participating in the violence. In a bold move, it was announced that individuals caught rioting or engaging in violent acts will face the permanent revocation of their government benefits. This decision reflects the severity of the situation and the authorities' determination to curb the ongoing disturbances.

The consequences extend beyond adults, as minor children found involved in violent activities will also face repercussions. Such actions will not only affect the individuals directly involved but will also have implications for their parents. Officials have stated that parents of minors caught rioting could lose their state benefits, face referrals to social services, and potentially even lose custody of their children. This multi-faceted approach aims to hold families accountable and deter future incidents.

City official Wilson Stewart has emphasized the importance of parental responsibility during this tumultuous time. He urged parents to closely monitor their children and be aware of their activities amidst the unrest. Stewart's comments highlight the critical role that families play in preventing youth involvement in violence and crime.

To further restore peace and safety in Charlotte, a mandatory curfew has been implemented. This measure is designed to limit movement during the night and reduce the potential for further disturbances. Authorities are hopeful that the curfew will aid in stabilizing the situation and allow the community to begin the process of healing.

As the city grapples with the aftermath of the riots, the focus remains on restoring order and ensuring the safety of its residents. The declaration of a state of emergency and the involvement of the National Guard signify the seriousness of the situation and the commitment of local and state officials to address the unrest decisively.

The events in Charlotte serve as a stark reminder of the challenges that communities can face in times of crisis. The emphasis on accountability for both individuals and families reflects a broader concern for the social fabric of the city. As the situation continues to develop, the eyes of the nation remain on Charlotte, watching closely to see how local leaders navigate the complexities of restoring peace while addressing the underlying issues that have led to such unrest.

In the coming days, the city will be under scrutiny as it works to enforce the curfew and implement the new policies regarding government benefits. The hope is that these measures will not only quell the current violence but also instill a sense of responsibility among residents to prevent future occurrences. The road to recovery will undoubtedly be challenging, but the commitment to action is a crucial first step toward healing the community.",-33.0,-8.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,545.0,-0.34782608695652173,-0.014678899082568808

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

FBI Director James Comey is under increasing scrutiny as calls for his resignation grow louder in the wake of his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal. The controversy surrounding Comey intensified after it was revealed that he granted immunity to several of Clinton's top aides, including her Chief of Staff, Cheryl Mills, who has been accused of not fully cooperating with the investigation.

The House Judiciary Committee has announced a hearing scheduled for September 28th, aimed at assessing Comey's future in light of the mounting criticism. This hearing comes as Congress seeks to understand the rationale behind Comey's decisions during the investigation, particularly his controversial moves to grant immunity to key figures in the case.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has emerged as a prominent critic of Comey, openly calling for his resignation. DiGenova has questioned Comey's fitness for office, labeling the investigation as fundamentally flawed. He characterized it as more of a ""protected investigation"" than a genuine effort to uncover the truth, raising concerns about the integrity of the FBI's approach to the case.

The scrutiny on Comey is not limited to public opinion; Congress is actively holding hearings to investigate his actions. A subpoena has been issued for Comey to provide documents related to the email scandal, further emphasizing the urgency with which lawmakers are pursuing answers. However, Comey has faced criticism for his repeated failure to comply with Congress's requests for these documents, which has only fueled the fire of discontent among his detractors.

As the hearings approach, the pressure on Comey to clarify his decisions and provide transparency regarding the investigation is mounting. Lawmakers are eager to understand why certain individuals were granted immunity and how this decision may have impacted the overall investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State.

The political ramifications of Comey's actions are significant, as they have sparked a broader debate about accountability and the role of the FBI in high-profile investigations. With the upcoming hearing, both supporters and critics of Comey are preparing for a contentious examination of his leadership and decision-making processes.

As the situation continues to evolve, the outcome of the House Judiciary Committee's hearing could have far-reaching implications for Comey and the FBI. The investigation into Clinton's email scandal may have begun as a legal inquiry, but it has now transformed into a critical examination of the FBI's credibility and the integrity of its leadership.

In the coming weeks, all eyes will be on the Judiciary Committee as it seeks to hold Comey accountable and determine the future of his tenure as FBI Director. The stakes are high, not only for Comey but for the public's trust in one of the nation's most prominent law enforcement agencies.",-17.0,-13.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,528.0,-0.7222222222222222,-0.02462121212121212

In a shocking revelation that has drawn international condemnation, reports have surfaced indicating that Saudi Arabia is auctioning off women who were enslaved by the Islamic State (ISIS). Eyewitness accounts have confirmed that these women, including Yazidi girls, are being sold in public auctions to a variety of buyers, including both Saudis and Westerners. This disturbing practice highlights the ongoing plight of women who have been victims of one of the most brutal terrorist organizations in recent history.

The Islamic State has a notorious history of abusing and trafficking sex slaves, particularly targeting non-Muslim women. Despite the global outcry against such heinous acts, the reality for many rescued women is grim. Rather than being liberated and provided with the support they need, many find themselves sold into further exploitation. This cycle of abuse raises urgent questions about the effectiveness of rescue efforts and the responsibility of the international community to protect these vulnerable individuals.

The situation is further complicated by the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, a country that has faced scrutiny for its human rights record. The majority of the terrorists involved in the September 11 attacks were from Saudi Arabia, including members of the influential Bin Laden family. This historical context has led to heightened concerns regarding the U.S. government’s continued support for the Saudi regime, particularly in light of its involvement in human rights abuses.

Criticism has also been directed at political figures, notably Hillary Clinton, who has been accused of accepting significant financial contributions from Saudi Arabia—reportedly funding 20% of her campaign. This relationship has raised ethical questions about her willingness to engage with a country implicated in the trafficking of women and the funding of terrorism. Critics argue that such ties are indicative of a broader complicity among political leaders in human rights violations, undermining the integrity of their positions.

The U.S. has long been a major arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, a fact that has become increasingly contentious given the kingdom's involvement in various conflicts and its questionable human rights practices. Calls are growing for the U.S. to reconsider its policy of selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, especially in light of the revelations surrounding the auctioning of ISIS sex slaves. Many advocates argue that the U.S. should not support a regime that perpetuates such atrocities, urging lawmakers to take a stand against these human rights violations.

The ongoing exploitation of women by ISIS and the subsequent auctioning of these victims in Saudi Arabia represents a profound moral crisis. The international community's response has been criticized as inadequate, with many calling for more decisive action to protect those who have suffered at the hands of this brutal organization. The trafficking of women is not just a regional issue; it is a global human rights concern that demands urgent attention from world leaders.

As the situation continues to unfold, the need for accountability and action has never been more pressing. Eyewitness accounts serve as a stark reminder of the realities faced by these women, and the complicity of various actors, including political leaders, raises serious ethical questions. The author of this article expresses deep distrust in those in power, suggesting that their actions—or lack thereof—are contributing to a culture of impunity surrounding these human rights abuses.

In conclusion, the auctioning of ISIS sex slaves in Saudi Arabia is a grave violation of human rights that cannot be ignored. The implications of this practice extend beyond the borders of the kingdom, calling into question the moral responsibilities of those who support such regimes. The time has come for the U.S. and other nations to reevaluate their relationships with countries that engage in these atrocities and take meaningful steps to protect the most vulnerable among us. The fight against human trafficking and exploitation must be at the forefront of global priorities, ensuring that those who have suffered are finally given the chance to heal and reclaim their lives.",-30.0,-64.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,733.0,-2.4615384615384617,-0.08731241473396999
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate of the election season was marked by intense exchanges between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and her Republican rival Donald Trump. As the candidates squared off, NBC’s Lester Holt moderated the event, but not without facing criticism for his approach. Many observers noted that Holt interrupted Trump multiple times to ""fact-check"" him, with several of these fact-checks later deemed incorrect.

A particularly contentious moment arose when Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from its inception. Trump vehemently denied this claim, asserting that he had expressed reservations about the invasion. However, Holt did not extend the same scrutiny to Clinton regarding her vote for the war, instead focusing primarily on Trump's past comments. This discrepancy in questioning raised eyebrows among viewers and analysts alike.

In a post-debate interview, Trump elaborated on his stance regarding the Iraq War, revealing his uncertainty and suggesting that there should be either decisive action or none at all. This statement appeared to contradict Holt's assertion during the debate, further complicating the narrative surrounding Trump's position on the war.

Critics of the debate's moderation argued that Holt should have pressed Clinton about her vote for the Iraq War, rather than solely targeting Trump. This lack of balance in questioning has drawn attention to the broader issue of media bias, with some suggesting that the mainstream media is attempting to undermine Trump during the election cycle.

Despite the challenges he faced from both Clinton and the media, Trump was noted for standing his ground throughout the debate. His ability to maintain composure in the face of scrutiny showcased his determination to present his views clearly and assertively.

As the debate concluded, the focus shifted to the implications of the exchanges and the role of the moderator in shaping the conversation. The debate highlighted the contentious nature of the election and set the stage for future discussions as both candidates prepare for the upcoming debates.

In summary, the first presidential debate not only illuminated the stark differences between Clinton and Trump but also raised questions about the effectiveness and impartiality of the moderation. With the election drawing near, the dynamics of the debate are likely to influence voter perceptions and the overall trajectory of the campaign.",-9.0,-22.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,427.0,-1.2941176470588236,-0.05152224824355972
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

The Birther movement, a political phenomenon that gained traction during Barack Obama's presidency, has raised significant questions regarding the former president's birthplace and citizenship. Central to this discussion is a 2004 article published by Breitbart, which controversially asserted that Obama was “Kenyan-born” and poised to secure a seat in the U.S. Senate. This claim emerged as Obama was gaining momentum in the race for the Illinois Senate seat, particularly after his rival, Jack Ryan, withdrew due to a scandal.

The Breitbart article remains accessible online, and notably, Obama has not publicly refuted its claims. This silence has fueled ongoing speculation and debate over the legitimacy of his American birth. Adding to the complexity of the situation is a promotional booklet from 1991, distributed by Obama’s literary agency, which describes him as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” This document was intended for colleagues in the publishing industry and included a biography that has since been scrutinized for its implications.

Critics have raised serious questions about the authenticity of Obama's American birth, particularly in light of the claims made in the 1991 booklet. If Obama indeed asserted that he was born in Kenya, this raises the issue of whether his American birth is valid or if he was being deceptive in his biography. The ramifications of such contradictions could be significant, suggesting a potential personal gain from being perceived as a foreigner.

The Birther movement has not only challenged Obama’s citizenship but has also highlighted the broader implications of identity and narrative in American politics. By examining these contradictions in Obama’s story, the movement invites a deeper consideration of how political narratives are constructed and the motivations behind them. 

As the conversation around Obama’s origins continues, it becomes clear that the implications extend beyond mere speculation. The questions raised by the Birther movement touch on themes of authenticity, identity, and the impact of public perception on political careers. The ongoing discourse encourages readers to reflect critically on the narratives presented by public figures and the consequences of those narratives in the political landscape.

In summary, the discussion surrounding the Birther movement and Barack Obama’s origins remains a contentious and complex issue. The interplay of media, personal biography, and political narrative continues to shape public understanding and opinions, making it a significant topic for ongoing examination.",-18.0,0.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,457.0,0.0,0.0

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In the wake of the recent debate, Hillary Clinton's performance has become a focal point of discussion, particularly regarding her apparent lack of coughing and her preparedness with answers. Observers noted a significant change in her demeanor; Clinton did not reach for water or exhibit her usual coughing fits, which has sparked curiosity among viewers and commentators alike.

The absence of her typical coughing episodes was not the only thing that caught the attention of the audience. Social media has been buzzing with speculation about a flesh-colored device that was spotted in her ear during the debate. This has led to a flurry of questions regarding the nature of the device—was it an earpiece, a hearing aid, or simply a fashion accessory?

Clinton's campaign spokesperson, Nick Merrill, has attempted to quell the speculation, asserting that the image is merely a reflection caused by television lights or a flash. Despite this explanation, the intrigue surrounding the device has not subsided. Observers are left wondering whether it was indeed a technological aid or just a trick of the light.

Adding fuel to the fire, a WikiLeaks email exchange between Clinton and her aide Huma Abedin has surfaced, raising eyebrows further. In the email, Clinton inquires whether an earpiece was taken, which has led some to speculate about her reliance on external assistance during the debate. This correspondence has been interpreted by some as evidence that Clinton may require help to communicate effectively, igniting a debate over the implications of such a dependency.

The commentary on social media reflects a divided opinion on the matter. Some users suggest that the device could potentially be a hearing aid, while others maintain that it is merely a reflection from the lighting setup used during the debate. This division leaves the issue open to interpretation and highlights the varying perceptions of Clinton's performance.

As the discourse continues, it is clear that the debate has not only raised questions about Clinton's performance but has also opened a broader conversation about the scrutiny public figures face in the age of social media. The speculation surrounding the device in her ear illustrates how quickly narratives can develop and how they can overshadow the substantive issues discussed during political debates.

In summary, while Hillary Clinton's debate performance was marked by her lack of coughing and readiness with answers, the appearance of a mysterious device in her ear has captured the attention of viewers and social media users alike. With differing opinions on what the device truly represents and the implications of its presence, the debate has sparked a conversation that extends beyond Clinton's performance to touch on the nature of political communication in the modern era. As the speculation continues, the focus remains on how these discussions will shape public perception leading into future debates and the election.",-5.0,5.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,527.0,0.2631578947368421,0.009487666034155597
