Bill Clinton: â€˜Naturalâ€™ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Hereâ€™s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was â€œoh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wifeâ€™s campaign now?â€ù

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people donâ€™t do, to find out the real story â€“ and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

â€œIt was natural for people whoâ€™ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldnâ€™t do anything they shouldnâ€™t do,â€ù Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but thereâ€™s no evidence they got them.

Now, letâ€™s talk about the foundation the media doesnâ€™t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasnâ€™t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trumpâ€™s charitable foundation over concerns that it â€œengaged in some improprietyâ€ù as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled othersâ€™ contributions â€œto make them appear to have come from himâ€ù although he â€œhasnâ€™t given to the foundation since 2008.â€ù Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clintonâ€™s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the â€œdouble standardâ€ù in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clintonâ€™s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Postâ€™s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trumpâ€™s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton â€œscandalâ€ù (if you call getting sick a â€œscandalâ€ù) while ignoring every scandal in Trumpâ€™s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Heâ€™s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned â€œrapistsâ€ù and â€œdrug dealersâ€ù from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a â€œtemporary measure.â€ù Heâ€™s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

â€œThe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, donâ€™t kid yourself. When they say they donâ€™t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.â€ù

But heâ€™s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donaldâ€™s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism â€” heâ€™s fighting the â€œnarrativesâ€ù of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trumpâ€™s â€œnarrativeâ€ù is â€œkill them allâ€ù:

Last weekendâ€™s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obamaâ€™s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes weâ€™re in more than a fight about â€˜narrativesâ€™ â€“ these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: â€œThey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.â€ù

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is â€œradical Islamic terrorism,â€ù and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating â€œterrorists?â€ù

â€œTheyâ€™re protecting each other, but theyâ€™re really doing very bad damage â€” they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,â€ù Trump said in March. â€œWhen they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and thatâ€™s a big problem.â€ù

If Muslims are â€œprotectingâ€ù terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trumpâ€™s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terroristsâ€™ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself â€” but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponentsâ€™ security to â€œsee what happensâ€ù to them (shortly after suggesting that â€œSecond Amendment Peopleâ€ù could deal with them. Weâ€™re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the â€˜little red buttonâ€™ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

Itâ€™s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen â€” one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. Heâ€™s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation â€” to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if itâ€™s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

Weâ€™ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably â€œread my lipsâ€?no new taxes,â€ù a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekendâ€™s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO â€” Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didnâ€™t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Letâ€™s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. â€œDestroyâ€ù doesnâ€™t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty â€œyeeeeehaw,â€ù the reality is that heâ€™s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. Heâ€™s talking about profiling Muslims. Heâ€™s talking about Donald Trumpâ€™s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isnâ€™t just a Muslim, heâ€™s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isnâ€™t just a Muslim, heâ€™s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because heâ€™s a suspect in a bombing doesnâ€™t mean heâ€™s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked â€œkillâ€ù and not on the most wanted list. Thereâ€™s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trumpâ€™s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think Iâ€™m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isnâ€™t about the narrative. It isnâ€™t about prevention or education.

Itâ€™s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what heâ€™s promising is nothing but another â€œread my lips.â€ù Terrorism isnâ€™t something you can simply â€œdestroyâ€ù just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isnâ€™t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasnâ€™t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that weâ€™ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was â€œPapaâ€ù John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employeesâ€™ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didnâ€™t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesnâ€™t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carlâ€™s Jr. and Hardeeâ€™s. Hereâ€™s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But thatâ€™s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesnâ€™t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

â€œI want to try it,â€ù CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. â€œWe could have a restaurant thatâ€™s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.â€ù â€œWith government driving up the cost of labor, itâ€™s driving down the number of jobs,â€ù he says. â€œYouâ€™re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.â€ù â€œThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,â€ù says Puzder. â€œDoes it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?â€ù Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. Heâ€™s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees donâ€™t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

â€œThereâ€™s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they wonâ€™t know the law, and theyâ€™ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,â€ù Gitlin said. â€œThat can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.â€ù

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And thatâ€™s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

â€œWeâ€™re going to watch Pennsylvania,â€ù Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. â€œGo down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people donâ€™t come in and vote five times. If you do that, weâ€™re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion â€“ I really mean this, Pennsylvania â€“ is if cheating goes on.â€ù

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to â€œStop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!â€ù

In response to Trumpâ€™s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trumpâ€™s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Rooseveltâ€™s infamous line, â€œwe have nothing to fear but fear itself,â€ù the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of â€œterrorismâ€ù and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of â€œterrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongueâ€ù, he said. â€œThis is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.â€ù Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italyâ€™s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but Iâ€™m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and thatâ€™s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An Americanâ€™s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, thatâ€™s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasnâ€™t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, theyâ€™ve succeeded.

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying â€“ and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: â€œI didnâ€™t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.â€ù

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 â€” Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. â€” BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

â€œI didnâ€™t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said letâ€™s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said â€œHands Up, Donâ€™t Shoot,â€ù Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

â€œThe protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,â€ù Meyer told me almost breathlessly, â€œIâ€™ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant â€˜hands up, donâ€™t shootâ€™ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.â€ù

â€œAfter leaving â€˜The Epicenter,â€™ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful â€“ and thatâ€™s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.â€ù

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, â€œoh, absolutely.â€ù

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

â€œIt wasnâ€™t a gunshot,â€ù she told us. â€œIt was much louder. It wasnâ€™t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly â€˜They just shot himâ€™ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadnâ€™t already left, exited.â€ù

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was â€˜entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.â€™

CNN reports, â€œPolice say the person was shot by a civilian.â€ù

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protesterâ€™s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. â€” City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte policeâ€™s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

â€œI saw the man go down on the pavement,â€ù said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, â€œIt was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.â€ù

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV â€” Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook â€“ which was also shared via twitter â€“ that, â€œwithin 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.â€ù

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how â€“ with more violence.

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. Heâ€™s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; heâ€™s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. â€œFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russiaâ€ù he tweeted in July. Now â€“ brace yourself, this might come as a shock â€“ it appears heâ€™s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has â€œnumerous tiesâ€ù to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. â€œThe level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars â€” what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associateâ€”[and] be associated with Donald Trumpâ€ù says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to â€œlarge numbersâ€ù of Russian buyers â€“ so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as â€œLittle Moscow.â€ù

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense â€“ they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

â€œI think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumptionâ€?They donâ€™t read books. They donâ€™t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yachtâ€ù says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as â€œcultural ignoramusesâ€?not interested in social justice.â€ù Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscowâ€™s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves â€“ and Trump himself. â€œWeâ€™ll be looking at that, yeah weâ€™ll be lookingâ€ù said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, itâ€™s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

New Jerseyâ€™s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the â€œBridgegateâ€ù scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidentialâ€™s nominee Donald Trumpâ€™s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the worldâ€™s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trumpâ€™s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major â€œconservativeâ€ù Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trumpâ€™s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. Itâ€™s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governorâ€™s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administrationâ€™s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this yearâ€™s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because â€œhe wouldâ€™ve gotten it, if I wanted it.â€ù But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul â€“ this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lieâ€”a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trumpâ€™s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesnâ€™t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bushâ€™s story reinforced what Trump was saying at ralliesâ€”he had played the â€œcash for outcomesâ€ù political game for yearsâ€”he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bushâ€™s oppositionâ€”if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush wouldâ€™ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trumpâ€™s naÃ¯ve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwaldâ€™s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadnâ€™t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simpleâ€”Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater â€œscandalâ€ù for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trumpâ€™s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his partyâ€™s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on itâ€™s head.

Trumpâ€™s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but itâ€™s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, thereâ€™s no third option here:

Bush: â€œThe one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on somethingâ€”that was generous and gave me moneyâ€”was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.â€ù Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didnâ€™tâ€” Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didnâ€™t get it, because I was opposed toâ€” Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling beforeâ€” Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. Iâ€™m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, â€œDid you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?â€ù Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bushâ€?and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didnâ€™t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didnâ€™t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonightâ€™s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon â€“ thank you! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

Whatâ€™s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from â€“ which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

Thatâ€™s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putinâ€™s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. Itâ€™s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putinâ€™s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: â€œhumourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.â€ù

So remember â€“ donâ€™t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the companyâ€™s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendmentâ€™s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trumpâ€™s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. â€œThe likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,â€ù the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nomineeâ€™s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thielâ€™s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now heâ€™s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hoganâ€™s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaireâ€™s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOPâ€™s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, â€œEvery American has a unique identity. Iâ€™m proud to be gay, Iâ€™m proud to be a Republican,â€ù after a lengthy rant against â€œgovernment incompetence.â€ù He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didnâ€™t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

â€œFederal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,â€ù said the Department of Laborâ€™s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. â€œOur nationâ€™s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.â€ù Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself â€œvigorouslyâ€ù and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer â€“ the federal government â€“ of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his companyâ€™s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the Presidentâ€™s crimes.

Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that heâ€™s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. Heâ€™s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. Heâ€™s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. Heâ€™s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to â€œrelaxâ€ù he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

Itâ€™s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before heâ€™s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that heâ€™s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trumpâ€™s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together itâ€™s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Justâ€?what is he talking about? If youâ€™re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. Heâ€™s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable â€“ except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics â€?. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator â€? to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trumpâ€™s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, itâ€™s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to â€œshineâ€ù at the debate if she hopes to â€œwin.â€ù This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, itâ€™s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.
