Real_1-Webpage,Another Terrorist Attack in NYC…Why Are we STILL Being Politically Correct – Eagle Rising,"On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a “pressure cooker” device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.

Given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn’t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the “bad guys.” Unfortunately, our leadership – who ostensibly wants to protect us – finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – who famously ended “stop-and-frisk” profiling in his city – was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. “There is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,” de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. “We believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and … agencies are at full alert”, he said. Isn’t “an intentional act” terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James O’Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word “terrorism” is defined. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.” Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his “obvious” assessment?

The two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that “we need to do everything we can to support our first responders – also to pray for the victims” and that “we need to let this investigation unfold.” Trump was more direct. “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” he said. “But boy we are living in a time—we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.”

Unfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as “soft targets.” Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.

Real_10-Webpage,"Donald Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests","Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.

""If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,"" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.

On Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.

The Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.

""Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.""

He continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.

""It's tough being a police officer,"" Trump said. ""Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed.""

But aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.

Trump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.

During a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,""

Many African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.

Trump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.

""I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,"" said Trump. ""We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.""

But this morning in an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.

In Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the ""violent disruptor"" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country""s job ""to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.""",http://abcn.ws/2d4lNn9,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg,"More Candace,Adam Kelsey,Abc News,More Adam",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437,"{""fb_title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""The police-involved shooting of a black man has sparked protests in Charlotte."", ""title"": ""Trump: Drugs a 'Very, Very Big Factor' in Charlotte Protests"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/AP_donald_trump_2_jt_160826_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@adam_kels"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-22"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-drugs-big-factor-charlotte-protests/story?id=42282437"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42282437"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-22"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-22 14:33:00"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Keith Lamont Scott, Protests, Election 2016, Charlotte, Pittsburgh""}",-51,768,-0.06640625,-37.2,766.6,-0.048666666,-47,797.8,-0.05932357,-54,784.4,-0.069551357,0.017739584,0.00708268,0.003145107,,Per word,,Orig,Temp0,Temp0.5,Temp1,

Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can’t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”.

Tuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”

So evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. “Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” Obama said.

Obama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.

How allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. It’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right? Obama has an agenda to push.",http://rightwingnews.com/barack-obama/obama-un-giving-liberty-enhances-security-america/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/obama-un.jpg,Cassy Fiano,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474476044000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/ji6pl5Vwrvk,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/obama-un.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/obama-un-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ZObama.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/barack-obama/obama-un-giving-liberty-enhances-security-america/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon.

“I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ‘Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act’ (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” Obama notes in the veto message.

“I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.”

The veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.

Suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.

The last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.

If passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.

Obama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries.

""Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today.

""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world.""

But the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists.

The House and Senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent. A veto override requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber, and the White House says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough Democrats to block the override effort.

Obama's former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election.",http://abcn.ws/2dh2NFs,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Obama_BM_20160616_16x9_992.jpg,"John Parkinson,More John,Abc News,More Alexander",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Obama_BM_20160616_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Obama_BM_20160616_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-vetoes-911-victims-bill-setting-showdown/story?id=42304768,"{""fb_title"": ""President Obama Vetoes 9/11 Victims Bill"", ""description"": ""President Obama has set up a showdown with Congress after vetoing the 9/11 victims bill."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""President Obama has set up a showdown with Congress after vetoing the 9/11 victims bill."", ""title"": ""President Obama Vetoes 9/11 Victims Bill"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-vetoes-911-victims-bill-setting-showdown/story?id=42304768"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Obama_BM_20160616_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""President Obama has set up a showdown with Congress after vetoing the 9/11 victims bill."", ""title"": ""President Obama Vetoes 9/11 Victims Bill"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-vetoes-911-victims-bill-setting-showdown/story?id=42304768"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Obama_BM_20160616_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@jparkABC"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42304768"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42304768"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-vetoes-911-victims-bill-setting-showdown/story?id=42304768""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-23"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42304768"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-vetoes-911-victims-bill-setting-showdown/story?id=42304768""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-obama-vetoes-911-victims-bill-setting-showdown/story?id=42304768"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42304768"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-23"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-23 16:47:42"", ""keywords"": ""President Barack Obama,veto,9/11,september 11,Saudi Arabia,sue,victims,international law,, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""article"": {""author"": ""/author/john_parkinson""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""President Barack Obama,veto,9/11,september 11,Saudi Arabia,sue,victims,international law""}",-7,550,-0.012727273,-4.2,598,-0.007040895,-1.2,623.4,-0.001700671,2.4,631.6,0.004013776,0.005686377,0.011026601,0.016741048,,Median,,-0.009259259,0.00227081,-0.001700671,0.004013776,(MEDIAN)

There’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. However, that’s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people.

The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.

But it quickly became dangerous, when the mob ambushed a female truck driver. She was trapped in the truck as the rioters looted her truck, stealing the goods and lighting them on fire, all while she was inside. She called police, but they never came. Instead, a media chopper got footage of the violence.

It didn’t stop there, though; by the end of the night, 16 police officers were injured and the freeway had been shut down.

Message to these Black Lives Matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That’s not a protest; it’s a riot. And it doesn’t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn’t fix anything.

Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It’s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,Cassy Fiano,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474473199000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LUv7x5bXV4,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8b602f8210f1a7d948ca1c0dcab11fad?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/riot.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/chaos-nc-protest-mob-ambushes-female-truck-driver-loots-truck-sets-cargo-fire-no-one-helps/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""There\u2019s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice.

Real_16-Webpage,Young Girl's Emotional Council Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting,"Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.

But none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.

Zianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears streaking her face, brought into focus the stress police shootings place on children, as well as the pain the black community of Charlotte has suffered in the wake of Scott's death last week.

“I’ve been born and raised in Charlotte. And I never felt this way until now and I can’t stand how we’re treated,” the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.

She expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children.

“It’s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn’t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,” she said.

Zianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted ""no justice, no peace"" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina’s most populous city since the shooting.

Protests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.

The scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.

At the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.

After the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.

“Release. Release. The whole damn tape,” the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.

Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News.

Chief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him.",http://abcn.ws/2cTj7ap,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,"More Michael,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting3_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting1_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting2_MEM_160927_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_12x5_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939,"{""fb_title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""description"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Peaceful protesters crowded Charlotte's first city council meeting since the cop shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, with over 50 people speaking out against police violence.\nBut none of them stood out Monday quite as much as a young girl.\nZianna Oliphant, her hair done up in braids and tears..."", ""title"": ""Young Girl's Emotional Speech Laments 'Shame' of Fatal Charlotte Shooting"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Charlotte_Police_Fatal_Shooting4_MEM_160927_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@MichaelEHayden"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-27"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/US/young-girls-emotional-council-speech-laments-shame-fatal/story?id=42389939"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42389939"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-27"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-27 15:03:26"", ""keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter, us news, national news, local news"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Charlotte, BLM, Black lives matter""}",-57,570,-0.1,-30.4,593.4,-0.05126049,-32.6,615.8,-0.053651728,-46.6,621.4,-0.075100809,0.04873951,0.046348272,0.024899191,,Min,,-0.125,-0.106439517,-0.101376878,-0.097943535,(MIN)
Real_17-Webpage,Jeb Bush to lecture at Harvard this fall,"Story highlights Bush will deliver his first lecture on Thursday

He is a staunch advocate for charter schools, voucher programs and higher education standards

(CNN) Jeb Bush will be a guest lecturer at Harvard University this fall, focusing on education in ""a number of multi-day visits"" this semester, the John F. Kennedy School of Government announced Tuesday.

The former Florida governor and Republican presidential candidate -- who was known for his wonkish love of policy on the campaign trail -- will deliver his first lecture on Thursday.

He'll also co-lecture in a course titled, ""The Political Economy of the School,"" and participate in faculty-led student study groups.

After dropping out of the presidential race in February, Bush returned to his position as chairman and president of the board of directors at an organization he started called the Foundation for Excellence in Education.

Bush -- a staunch advocate for charter schools, voucher programs and higher education standards -- attempted to make education a defining hallmark of his presidential campaign.

Real_2-Webpage,Hillary Clinton on police shootings: 'too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have',"Story highlights ""This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have,"" Clinton said

The deaths of black civilians in confrontations with the police has taken center stage in the election

Orlando (CNN) Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are ""unbearable"" and ""intolerable.""

Clinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma, but revisited the issue Wednesday in light of the death of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina. Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force.

""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.""

The Democratic nominee added: ""I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.""

Even as she referred to the deaths as ""two very upsetting incidents,"" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.

Gary Johnson said a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among Democrats, in particular, that he’s snatching votes from Clinton.

“The people voting for me are voting for Gary Johnson,” the Libertarian presidential contender said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” with George Stephanopoulos. “I take great pride in the fact that I am actually offering an alternative. … Fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents. How is it that we can only have two candidates?”

“I’m going to sleep well at the end of all this, giving people a first vote, not a second vote, not a lesser of two evils.”

Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, who spoke earlier on the same program, shrugged off Johnson’s impact on the race.

“He’s taking votes from both candidates, but your own poll showed that his numbers are — are dropping,” he said, referring to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed Johnson dipping to 5 percent support. “I don’t think that they’re — that either of the third-party candidates are really going to factor into the head-to-head in this race.”

An inquiry was opened, although no formal complaint has been filed. Federal officials have issued a subpoena for Weiner’s cell phone records.

Federal prosecutors will not confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation, per Justice Department policy. The investigation was first reported yesterday by the Daily Mail.

Asked for comment at an unrelated press conference, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, ""If the reports are true, it's possibly criminal and it is sick.

Real_22-Webpage,Senate Dems Move To Force Trump To Release His Tax Returns,"11.7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

The Senate reconvened this week as Democrats introduced a transparency in Presidential candidates bill that would force Donald Trump to release his tax returns, if Republicans would only be willing to face everything their racist nominee has done in his business career:

Democrats are backing legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party’s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. “We’re going to be here next week. We’re probably going to have some downtime,” Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. “There’s no reason we couldn’t vote.”

Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation’s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

In the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!

But America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney’s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat’s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:

Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is “ethically compromised” and the “king of the welfare kings.”

Ironically, Romney’s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.

American voters deserve to know what’s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump’s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.

Real_23-Webpage,Dem congressman to IRS: Audit the Trump Foundation,"Story highlights Trump reportedly used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes,"" Sander Levin wrote to the IRS

Washington (CNN) Michigan Democratic Rep. Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements.

""It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J. Trump Foundation,"" Levin wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen

The Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament.

The revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing. Messages left with the Trump campaign and the IRS were not immediately returned Wednesday.

But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a top Trump surrogate, warned Hillary Clinton's campaign Wednesday of using the allegations against the Trump Foundation for a political attack.

Real_24-Webpage,Armed Intruders Break in House…Armed Resident Responds – Eagle Rising,"Friday morning around 4:00, three men – some of whom were armed – barged in through one of the doors of an Atlanta resident’s house. The resident’s co-worker was over for work-related reasons, and when she heard the commotion, she sprung into action, wielding a handgun.

The whole episode was caught on surveillance camera that was set up inside the house. The resident’s co-worker unloaded all the rounds from her gun into the intruders’ direction, sending all three of them out the door. One of the intruders even jumped through a glass door. Two intruders are still on the loose, and a third one died from his gunshot wounds in the driveway.

After the gunfight, the homeowner can be seen calming down his housemate and taking the gun away.

In an interview with Channel 2, Gwinnett County Cpl. Dean Washington reacted to the incident: “She exercised her right to defend her livelihood and property.” He added: “It’s not common that we receive this caliber of surveillance video showing the crime unfold, an actual home invasion.”

Washington hopes that the surveillance video will also lead to their being able to capture the two remaining suspects: “They’re not wearing anything on their faces so we’re highly anticipating someone watching the evening newscast will recognize these people.”

Real_25-Webpage,"Post-debate, Trump team hits moderator Holt for 'some hostile questions'","""He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about,"" Donald Trump said about Lester Holt. | Getty Post-debate, Trump team hits moderator Holt for 'some hostile questions'

Donald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandals.

“They were leaving all of her little goodies out. They didn't ask her about, you know, much,” Trump said on Fox News’s “Fox and Friends.” “But I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did — I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.”

Story Continued Below

Still, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said “went really well” despite “some hostile questions.” The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump’s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit.

“I didn’t think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,” Trump said. “That's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it’s older because then you’ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say “’Wow I didn’t know Trump was that old.’ Hey, she’ll be unimpressed.”

“Well, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,” he said. “He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.”

Attacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.

""I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy – the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya – that never came up,"" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.

Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.

“I just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,"" she said. ""You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.""

While the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.

“I had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,” he said. “My microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.”

Asked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, “Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November.""

“I know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,” he said. “She was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay. Hillary has to do what she has to do.”

Real_26-Webpage,One Critically Wounded As Charlotte Police Endure Second Night Of RIOTS… [VIDEO],"One Critically Wounded As Charlotte Police Endure Second Night Of RIOTS… [VIDEO]

In a second night of violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black police officer shot and killed an armed, black suspect, Keith Lamont Scott, things are spiraling out of control and the governor has declared an emergency there. One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.

Three other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can’t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.

From the Daily Mail:

National Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area – including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy – all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.

A number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.

On Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan ‘Black Lives Matter’ on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, “Stop – that’s not what this is about,” as young men broke bottles in the street.

After a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.

A riot is an uncontrollable beast… once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.

Real_27-Webpage,Rouhani: Iran deal able to weather the election,"Rouhani: Iran deal able to weather the election

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday expressed confidence that the landmark nuclear deal between his country and a group of world powers will be able to weather the volatile U.S. election season.

MSNBC's Chuck Todd asked Rouhani whether he'd rather work with Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, citing comments they've made on the nuclear deal. Rouhani said, ""Of course, throughout the atmosphere of presidential elections in the United States, candidates can bring up any topic that they see best suits the needs of their campaigns. But the reality remains that when the joint comprehensive plan of action was passed based on the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231, and it was approved unanimously, that became an international agreement.""

Story Continued Below

Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a ""bad deal"" and previously said he would tear it up. He's also called the Obama administration incompetent over it.

Clinton, on the other hand, has said she would respect the deal, yet be cautious in dealing with Iran, in what's come to be known as her ""distrust and verify"" strategy.

""No one can say here or there that I don't accept this agreement, I want to renegotiate it. This has purely an electoral effect for some,"" Rouhani said.

Real_28-Webpage,“How Can we LEAD When we Can’t Even Control Our Own Cities?” [VIDEO] – Eagle Rising,"Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Here’s what he said:

“Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times – because we’ve had some tough times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.

“Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag.

“We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country.

“Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?

“We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.

“Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end.

“The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that.

“There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration.

“Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people.”

Real_29-Webpage,9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him,"""Donald, you’re a sniveling coward,"" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him

Two months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party’s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.

That declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly — in part responding to Trump’s attacks on his wife and father.

Story Continued Below

1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump’s tax returns could show a mob connection

In February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn’t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” suggesting that they might show “Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.”

“The fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there’s a bombshell there,” Cruz said. “It’s natural to wonder, ‘Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?’”

2. In March, Cruz called him a “sniveling coward”

Speaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to “spill the beans” on the senator’s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, “Donald, you’re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.”

“It’s not easy to tick me off. I don’t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that’ll do it every time,” Cruz said.

3. He also called Trump a “big, loud New York bully”

“Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,” Cruz said . “It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.”

4. Also, “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women”

Trump’s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of “a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.”

5. Cruz called one of Trump’s theories “nuts” and “just kooky”

In May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz’s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: “This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let’s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.”

6. He also called him a “pathological liar” who “lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth”

Also in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : “I’m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.”

7. And Cruz was specific with the term “pathological”: Trump is “utterly amoral,” he said

“I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,” Cruz said .

8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a “serial philanderer”

Continuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : “He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, ‘Dude, what’s your problem?’’’

And: “Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He’s proud of being a serial philanderer.”

9. In July, Cruz still hadn’t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family

“I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,” Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.

Referring to his pledge to support his party’s nominee, Cruz said that statement “was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog"" and support him.

Real_3-Webpage,"Critical counties: Wake County, NC, could put up a fight","Critical Counties is a CNN series exploring 11 counties around the country that chief national correspondent John King has identified as key in the 2016 election. These counties could play an outsize role in the election and offer an instructive example of what the political parties have accomplished. Wake County is the fourth county in the series, which runs through Election Day. Explore the other critical counties.

Washington (CNN)

Few counties could prove more decisive in this election than Wake County, North Carolina.

A historically competitive county whose fortunes are on the rise, Wake could help deliver Hillary Clinton a win in a key battleground state -- or dash her hopes for the presidency. Simply put, if Clinton performs well in the highly educated research triangle, then election night bodes well for her. If Wake County doesn't come out for Clinton, Donald Trump's path to the White House would grow much clearer.

The county is rapidly expanding, and the influx of new people and industries could reshape the race. Meanwhile, the turmoil across the state in Charlotte after a police officer shot and killed a black man could add another focal point in the election — search data from Google Trends shows Wake County's spiking interest in ""police brutality"" this week.

Keep your eye on Wake County, and take a look at the fundamentals below.

Population

Wake County is fairly representative of the country in terms of race and ethnicity, but it has a more highly educated population, bigger incomes and a better job picture than the rest of the nation.

Real_30-Webpage,"Obama wears hat, breaking ‘Politics 101’ rule on headgear","Obama wears hat, breaking ‘Politics 101’ rule on headgear

President Barack Obama violated the longstanding, albeit unofficial, rule against presidential headgear on Monday when he accepted a hat and blanket at the White House Tribal Nations Conference.

The president was given the hat and blanket by Native American leaders as he took the stage ahead of remarks at the conference. He wore the blanket around his shoulders as a song was played in his honor, but took the hat off after just a few moments.

Story Continued Below

“What an amazing honor and what a kind gesture, for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,” Obama said once he took the podium. “I have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn’t steal mine. She would, too. I’m just saying.”

“That was very moving, and is a reminder of the great friendships that we’ve developed over the last eight years,” he added.

The unofficial rule against presidents wearing unusual hats is widely credited to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, whose decision to wear a tank-commander’s helmet during a ride in an M1A1 Abrams Main Battle Tank has been widely ridiculed to this day.

Obama himself acknowledged the rule during a 2013 visit from the Naval Academy’s football team, which presented him with one of its helmets.

“Here’s the general rule: You don’t put stuff on your head if you’re president,” Obama said, explaining his refusal to put on the helmet that had been fitted for him. “That’s Politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.”

Hillary Clinton on Tuesday warned that the nearly 50-day sprint to Election Day will impact far more than just the next four or eight years.

Making an appeal to black voters during an interview on the “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” Clinton stressed that voters can’t sit this one out.

Story Continued Below

“Every issue they care about is at stake in this election,” Clinton said. “This is not: ‘Oh, you know, a little here, a little there. We can — you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.’ No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.”

The former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they’re registered “because I need you.”

“We gotta stand up and be counted in this election,” she added.

Clinton’s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.

“My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” Obama said. “Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that’s on the ballot right now.”

But up next on the docket is the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday in New York, where the former senator expects to absorb a bunch of body blows from an aggressive foe.

“I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent,” she said. “You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff. I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.”

What Clinton won’t take, though, is any insults toward anyone else. “You know, his attacks on African-Americans and immigrants and Muslims and women and people with disabilities, it’s just — it’s just something we cannot tolerate,” she said.

As Clinton wrapped up her interview, Trump taunted her on Twitter: “Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!”

Real_33-Webpage,NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte – But It Wasn’t To Protest The National Anthem…,"NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte – But It Wasn’t To Protest The National Anthem…

As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are.

Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind… racism and violence are not of God.

From the Independent Review Journal:

But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. These people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer. The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now “North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” And the troopers weren’t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:

People in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn’t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not.

I was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group… they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474655224000},,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer4.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer1.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer2.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer3.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer5.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters."", ""title"": ""NC State Troopers Take A Knee Before Protecting Charlotte - But It Wasn't To Protest The National Anthem... | John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 750, ""identifier"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prayer-e1474652368217.jpg"", ""height"": 563}, ""url"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/nc-state-troopers-take-knee-protecting-charlotte-wasnt-protest-national-anthem/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""always"", ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 1631890973779575, ""pages"": 389658314427637}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Black Lives Matter"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-23T14:27:04-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/terresamonroe""}, ""google-site-verification"": ""SkBwg36QfD-9JmsE5roZWtBuTvXCuBAahBo8MiQVSEk"", ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}",3,580,0.005172414,32,607.2,0.052313244,34,599.4,0.056879926,26,605.8,0.043365162,0.04714083,0.051707513,0.038192748,,,,,,,,
Real_34-Webpage,Sacramento mayor punches pie thrower,"Story highlights A protester pied Sacramento's mayor in the face at a charity event Wednesday

The two scuffled afterward, and the protester was taken to a hospital for stitches

(CNN) Kevin Johnson -- the NBA star-turned-Sacramento mayor -- was pied in the face by a man at a charity dinner Wednesday night at the high school he once attended.

But the pie-thrower appeared to get the worst of it.

Sean Thompson, 32, approached the mayor, pulled a pie out of the bag and shoving it in his face -- setting off a short scuffle, in which Johnson punched Thompson in the face several times, according to witnesses descriptions of the scuffle in local media reports

""There was an altercation that occurred after he got the pie in the face,"" Sgt. Bryce Heinlein, a Sacramento police spokesman, told CNN.

""There were some punches thrown, and then the subject was quickly taken to the ground by one of the officers that is on the mayor's security detail"" and some event attendees, Heinlein said.

Real_35-Webpage,Megan Rapinoe Punished Over Not Standing For Anthem?,"U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe could face disciplinary action if she continues to kneel during the national anthem before games.

Despite an official statement from U.S. Soccer stating that both coaches and players are expected to stand at attention during the national anthem, Rapinoe continued to kneel at the Sept. 18 game against the Netherlands, protesting what she believes to be injustice and oppression in the United States.

Rapinoe first began her protest in solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who announced that he will not stand for the anthem as long as there is continued police brutality and racial prejudice in this country. His statements and actions have created a national movement, with athletes like Rapinoe following in his footsteps.

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true.

Her actions in particular have angered U.S. Soccer, which released a statement saying that her protest goes against everything the organization stands for.

""As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played,"" the statement reads in part, according to ESPN.

While she wasn't immediately punished for her protest, ESPN reports that the situation will be re-evaluated if Rapinoe continues to kneel throughout the rest of the season.

During a home game against the Netherlands, Rapinoe was met with some backlash when she refused to stand for the anthem, with one fan yelling, ""Stand up!""

Popular Video This young teenage singer was shocked when Keith Urban invited her on stage at his concert. A few moments later, he made her wildest dreams come true:

Nonetheless, Rapinoe has no plans of quitting her protest and is willing to risk suspension in order to make a statement.

""As of now I plan to keep kneeling,"" she told ESPN. ""I'm trying to kind of formulate a better plan and an action step moving forward. But until then, this is how I can help, this is how I can use my voice going forward, and this is how I can be an ally in this space.""",http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/megan-rapinoe-be-punished-over-not-standing-anthem?fb=rwn,http://s12.postimg.org/6xgybmfxp/rapinoe.png,,http://www.opposingviews.com,,,"http://s12.postimg.org/6xgybmfxp/rapinoe.png,http://www.opposingviews.com/sites/all/themes/ov_2017/img/OpposingViews.png,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-15e4OSeaAUAF6.gif,https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1522439921378351&ev=PageView&noscript=1,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8097945&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://www.opposingviews.com/sites/all/themes/ov_2017/img/render-logo.png,https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=745291502309008&ev=PageView&noscript=1,http://img.opposingviews.com/sites/default/files/styles/782x440/public/admin/OVDefault.jpg?itok=k4bdyP05",http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/megan-rapinoe-be-punished-over-not-standing-anthem,"{""msapplication-TileColor"": ""#0e0e0e"", ""description"": ""She will now be..."", ""title"": ""Megan Rapinoe Protests National Anthem Again Despite Warning, Pays The Price"", ""modernizr-version"": ""2.8.3"", ""foundation-version"": ""5.4.7"", ""jquery-version"": ""2.1.1"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Opposing Views"", ""description"": ""She will now be..."", ""title"": ""Megan Rapinoe Protests National Anthem Again Despite Warning, Pays The Price"", ""url"": ""http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/megan-rapinoe-be-punished-over-not-standing-anthem"", ""image"": ""http://s12.postimg.org/6xgybmfxp/rapinoe.png"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19T14:33:44+00:00"", ""theme-version"": ""1.2.4"", ""publish_date"": ""2016-09-19T14:33:44+00:00"", ""msapplication-TileImage"": ""/sites/all/themes/ov_2017/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png"", ""theme-color"": ""#0e0e0e"", ""keywords"": ""Megan Rapinoe,US Soccer,Colin Kaepernick,protesting the national anthem,Megan Rapinoe could face discipline for protesting the anthem"", ""ov"": {""id"": 881781}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"", ""news_keywords"": ""Megan Rapinoe,US Soccer,Colin Kaepernick,protesting the national anthem,Megan Rapinoe could face discipline for protesting the anthem""}",0,421,0,1.8,417.4,0.004291057,1.8,424.8,0.004079777,5.4,413.6,0.012997651,0.004291057,0.004079777,0.012997651,,,,,,,,
Real_36-Webpage,Liberals Are Furious When Reality Star Brody Jenner Tells the Truth About Police Shootings on Twitter,"Liberals Are Furious When Reality Star Brody Jenner Tells the Truth About Police Shootings on Twitter

It’s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and ill-informed.

Brody Jenner, however, has said something worth sharing.

Brody is the son of Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner and actress Linda Thompson, and stars in “The Hills,” a show that I’ve never seen and for which I can give you no description.

Twitter exploded after Brody Jenner posted a comment on Instagram claiming that not everything is about race. Of course, adding “All Lives Matter” was pretty much the end of it. The perpetually-offended crowd took to their keyboards to let him know that he’s a terrible person because he’s white and a man, and straight and “cis-gender.”

Below is the offending post:

“I normally don’t speak about this type of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I can’t even watch the news anymore without getting pissed off. This has nothing to do with race. White, black, brown, any color…if you have an officer of the law telling you to exit your vehicle (or do anything for that matter)…you comply. And not only do you comply, but you do so willingly and follow directions completely. And why in the world would you exit that vehicle with a weapon in hand (allegedly?!) That makes no sense! And if, let’s just say, you DON’T have a gun, why would you not put your hands up in the air and state “I do not have a gun” so that the officers can clearly see that you don’t??”

After receiving backlash, he posted another photo on Instagram, salting the wounds of the whining babies on the left.

Predictably, liberals lost their ever-loving minds over this, but it’s honestly just par for the course with these people. They are always looking for something by which they can be offended.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/liberals-furious-reality-star-brody-jenner-tells-truth-police-shootings-twitter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/brody-jenner-042016.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474930971000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/brody-jenner-042016.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/jenner.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/brody-jenner-042016-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/liberals-furious-reality-star-brody-jenner-tells-truth-police-shootings-twitter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""It\u2019s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and"", ""title"": ""Liberals Are Furious When Reality Star Brody Jenner Tells the Truth About Police Shootings on Twitter | John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 620, ""identifier"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/brody-jenner-042016.jpg"", ""height"": 413}, ""updated_time"": ""2016-09-27T16:55:55-04:00"", ""url"": ""http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/liberals-furious-reality-star-brody-jenner-tells-truth-police-shootings-twitter/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""always"", ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 1631890973779575, ""pages"": 389658314427637}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Black Lives Matter"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-26T19:02:51-04:00"", ""modified_time"": ""2016-09-27T16:55:55-04:00""}, ""google-site-verification"": ""SkBwg36QfD-9JmsE5roZWtBuTvXCuBAahBo8MiQVSEk"", ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}",-17,476,-0.035714286,-21.2,479,-0.043976058,-23.4,494,-0.047600365,-22.8,498.8,-0.045760955,0.008261773,0.01188608,0.01004667,,,,,,,,

Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile said Donald Trump’s refusal to apologize for spearheading the so-called “birther” movement that questioned the citizenship of Barack Obama is a “wound that won't heal.”

Recalling her visit over the weekend the newly-opened National Museum of African-American History and Culture as well as her own family’s history, Brazile said Trump’s hectoring of America’s first black president about his birth certificate recalled for her and many others the nation’s painful past.

Story Continued Below

“Donald Trump should take just a walk through that museum and see what it means to have to produce papers. I mean, my ancestors could not get papers simply because they were brought here as slaves. And it took centuries before we could finally get papers,” she told CNN’s “New Day” Tuesday morning. “To bring this up over and over again, and to smear the first black president of the United States, Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize. I get emotional. I got a birth certificate. My parents had a birth certificate. My grandparents did not. My great grandparents did not.”

The issue of Trump’s support for the birther movement was raised late in Monday night’s presidential debate by moderator Lester Holt, who asked Trump what he would say to Americans hurt by his championing of the issue. As he did at a press conference two weeks ago, Trump blamed Hillary Clinton and her associates for first raising the issue and took credit for bringing the matter to rest. To those who might have been offended, the Manhattan billionaire said “Well, I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce [his birth certificate].”

Brazile admitted that the apology she wants from Trump is “not forthcoming, so I know I'm speaking into the wild darkness of Donald Trump, but I think he should be ashamed of himself to bring that up and to say -- and this is what he said, ‘I'm the one who got him to produce the birth certificate.’ It's amazing.”

“I think it's a shame we put the president of the United States through this. It's just awful. And every time we talk about it, it's the wound. It’s the wound that won't heal,” she said. “And this is what Donald Trump should understand, it's the wound that will never heal as long as people go out there and exploit what I call real racial pain and animus in this country.”

Real_38-Webpage,US builds working theory on cause of Syrian airstrike,"(CNN) The mistaken US-led coalition bombing of a Syrian military position Saturday may have happened because the personnel weren't wearing military uniforms and didn't have standard military weapons, several US military officials told CNN.

Officials said they now think the personnel bombed may have been Syrian military prisoners, according to several US defense officials.

That's a working theory of how US, British, Danish and Australian aircraft may have incorrectly assessed intelligence and targeted the site that killed more than 60 Syrian personnel near Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. The UK Ministry of Defence is saying it used drones in the strike.

Officials emphasized there are no final conclusions by the US about who was struck. Overhead imagery and interviews with those involved will have to be assessed.

But the US is not disputing that Syrian personnel were hit. The US is trying to determine what specifically led to the mistaken strike and how the personnel may have been misidentified.

Jimmy Kimmel had an opportunity to bash Donald Trump in front of an audience of millions at the Emmys and he did not disappoint. He even went after Trump’s enablers who were sitting in the audience.

Kimmel opened the ceremony by poking fun of Hollywood’s elite and making several sarcastic but pointed jokes about diversity.

“This year’s nominees are the most diverse ever. And here in Hollywood, the only thing we value more than diversity is congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity. The Emmys are so diverse this year, the Oscars are telling people we’re one of their closest friends.”

But his greatest moment came when he mocked Trump. And called out the guy who made him a reality television celebrity.

Kimmel sarcastically riffed about the existence of television making it possible for such self-aggrandizing and bombastic egotists like Trump to thrive.

“If it weren’t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president? No. He would be at home right now quietly rubbing up against his wife Malaria, while she pretends to be asleep.”

And when it came to who was responsible for creating the five-alarm dumpster fire that is Donald Trump’s presidency, Kimmel singled out Mark Burnett, the brainchild behind Celebrity Apprentice.

“That’s right. That guy. Mark Burnett, the man who brought us ‘Celebrity Apprentice. Thanks to Mark Burnett, we don’t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we’re living in one. Thank you, Mark.”

Perhaps only the guy who invented the infomercial is responsible for more suffering than Mark Burnett. That’s why Kimmel nominated Burnett to be the first one tossed over Trump’s wall, should Trump convince enough deplorables to vote against their economic self-interests.

The social media site had similar arrangements for the conventions with CBS News, and is also streaming Thursday night NFL games and other sporting events. The debates will be available at debates.twitter.com, in Twitter Moments or on @bpolitics.

The stream will also include thirty minute shows before and after the debate with Bloomberg Politics Managing Editors Mark Halperin and John Heinemann. Twitter and Bloomberg already have a deal for live streaming three Bloomberg TV shows.

On Tuesday, Facebook announced it was teaming up with ABC for a similar streaming arrangement for the debates, along with commentary from the ABC News team before and after the debates.

Real_41-Webpage,Joe Biden Slams Donald Trump's Comment That Housing Crisis Was 'Good Business',"During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump’s debate performance Monday night –- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis.

""This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?"" Biden said during a rally at Drexel University. ""Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.""

Biden asked the crowd if they could imagine Ronald Reagan, ""saying it's good business to take advantage of people’s misery, rooting for that misery?""

""He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have,"" Biden said. ""They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from 'You’re fired.' They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.""

During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said Trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, ""That's called business, by the way.""

""When you’re sitting atop Trump Tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that I grew up with?"" Biden said of Trump.

The vice president also criticized Trump's suggestion that not paying taxes ""makes me smart.""

""He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart,"" Biden said. ""Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

He added that the views Trump expressed in the debate demonstrate his outlook on the country.

""If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord,"" Biden said about the debate.

Real_42-Webpage,National poll: Clinton leads Trump by 6,"Story highlights Hillary Clinton has a 6-point lead over Donald Trump in a four way race, according to a new poll

Clinton has the edge over Trump on a number of key issues in the poll ahead of the first presidential debate

(CNN) Hillary Clinton holds a solid 6-point lead over Donald Trump heading into the first presidential debate next Monday, according to a new national poll released Friday.

The McClatchy-Marist poll found Clinton leading Trump 45% to 39% among likely voters in a four-way race. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 10% support, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein polled at 4%. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll this week found Clinton leading by a similar margin, 43% to 37%.

Clinton maintains a massive lead among black voters in the new poll, pacing Trump 93% to 3% despite high-profile efforts by the Trump campaign to improve its outreach to minority voters. Clinton also has a large advantage over Trump among Latinos, 74% to 16%, but her support shrinks to 60% when third-party options are included.

Both candidates continue to struggle with low favorability numbers -- 40% of likely voters say they have a favorable opinion of Clinton, and 37% say the same about Trump.

Trump has a slight edge on the question of who is ""honest and trustworthy,"" as 44% of likely voters think he is, while 36% think that Clinton is. The two run about even when voters pick who ""shares their values"" and who ""cares about people like them."" And Clinton beats Trump handily on ""know how to do the job"" and temperament.

Real_43-Webpage,“Public School Forced My Child To,"7.5k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A public high school has been accused of indoctrinated Islam into their students. Allegedly, the school has been mandating children profess the Islamic statement of faith, memorize the five pillars of Islam, as well as teaching students that the Muslims faith is stronger than a Christian or Jews. This is all according to lawsuit filed in federal court this past Wednesday.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of John and Melissa Wood with the Thomas More Law Center and the action is being taken against La Plata High School in Maryland. According to John Wood the school banished him from their property when he complained about the Islamic teachings.

Richard Thompson, President of Thomas More, said,

“Defendants forced Wood’s daughter to disparage her Christian faith by reciting the Shahada, and acknowledging Mohammed as her spiritual leader.”

The Law Center commented that for non Muslims such as Christians and Jews that reciting the Shahada Islamic creed which is their statement of faith is the equivalent of converting.

Spokespeople for the Charles County Public Schools have refused to comment other than to say they have not received any such lawsuit yet. However, the Principal Evelyn Arnold, Vice Principal Shannon Morris, and Charles County Board of Education were all named in the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says,

“During its brief instruction on Christianity, Defendants failed to cover any portion of the Bible or other non-Islamic religious texts, such as the Ten Commandments. Instead, the class included disparaging remarks about Christianity and the Pope. Such discriminatory treatment of Christianity is an unconstitutional promotion of one religion over another. United States Supreme Court precedent does not create a double standard that allows for the promotion of Islam in our public schools while disallowing and silencing teachings of Christianity and Judaism.”

Classroom assignment copies indicate the teachers were instructing students that most Muslim people’s faith are stronger than that of the average Christian. As well, the copies show they taught students that Islam is a peaceful religion that treated their conquered nations with kindness and respect too.

Part of the handout reads,

“Nowhere in the Koran does it say you will go to paradise if you martyr yourself with a suicide bomb. Important: The majority of Muslims do not live this way.”

It referenced the jihad as,

“a holy war waged on behalf of Islam as a religious duty; a personal struggle in devotion to Islam especially involving spiritual discipline.”

This reportedly occurred during the 2014-2015 school year. So lord only knows what these teachers have been education these students about for the past few years. Despite the fact the Thomas More Center has taken on this case neither the American Civil Liberties Union or the Freedom From Religion Foundation have weighed in on the issue.",http://freedomdaily.com/outraged-parents-file-lawsuit-public-school-forced-my-child-to-convert-to-islam/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-58.jpeg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Real_47-Webpage,KISS Bassist Gene Simmons on How to Stop Islamic Terrorism,"“[Ahmad Khan Rahami] should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” — Rock Legend Gene Simmons commenting on recent NY/NJ bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami

Hall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years he’s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.

Simmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.

“Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, then profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.”

But what about the people who were being “unfairly” profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exists.”

BOOM.

Thank you for being awesome, Mr. Simmons. Maybe when Donald Trump gets elected President he’ll consider making Gene Simmons the director of Homeland Security? Ooh, and then KISS could play at all of the White House State functions! Hey, I can dream, can’t I?

Real_48-Webpage,"Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable'","(CNN) Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

""There are two prongs to her approach,"" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.""

""There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,"" he continued. ""These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.""

Clinton spoke out Tuesday against ""systematic racism"" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer.

Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.

""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said.

Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.

""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said. ""If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.""

Clinton said Tuesday that while there are ""good, honorable, cool-headed police officers"" working across the country, ""we can do better.""

""We have got to tackle systemic racism,"" Clinton said. ""This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?""

""This is just unbearable,"" Clinton said. ""And it needs to be intolerable.""

Clinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, ""Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H.""

Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 20, 2016

In response to the Crutcher shooting, both the Department of Justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting.

Danny C. Williams, US Attorney of the Northern District of Oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. Authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation.",http://cnn.it/2cQyS4N,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,"Dan Merica,Eugene Scott",http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161118161709-cop-punches-woman-in-face-thumb-1-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718110446-02-officer-mohamed-noor-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717224427-justine-ruszczyk-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170711043320-georgia-police-beating-jnd-orig-vstop-00000612-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170104090632-north-carolina-school-body-slam-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170720014308-baltimore-pd-body-cam-video-release-02-large-169.jpg,data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170626185531-jordan-edwards-roy-oliver-split-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712182221-florida-state-attorney-aramis-ayala-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170818111936-dashcam-video-ohio-violent-arrest-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160707080401-philando-castile-facebook-2-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160520225617-georgia-man-tased-death-police-pkg-00012201-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717113139-australian-woman-minneapolis-police-shooting-nr-00000812-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170718090944-betsy-hodges-7-18-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170712054244-louisiana-couple-police-shooting-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160428084627-baltimore-teen-replica-gun-shot-dnt-00001823-large-169.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160919225954-tulsa-shooting-1-exlarge-169.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html,"{""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""author"": ""Eugene Scott and Dan Merica, CNN"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNN"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""pubdate"": ""2016-09-20T15:39:52Z"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings"", ""url"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html"", ""image"": {""width"": 1100, ""identifier"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""height"": 619}, ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""politics"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 80401312489, ""pages"": ""5550296508,18793419640""}, ""thumbnail"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""template-top"": ""politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid-col,col-controversial-police-incidents-"", ""vr"": {""canonical"": ""http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/terence-crutcher-tulsa-shooting-hillary-clinton/index.html""}, ""keywords"": ""Hillary Clinton, Clinton, Election 2016, US election, Tulsa, shooting, politics, Clinton: Tulsa shooting 'unbearable,' should be 'intolerable' - CNNPolitics"", ""article"": {""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/EugeneScott202""}, ""lastmod"": ""2016-09-21T14:20:33Z"", ""twitter"": {""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160917174321-hillary-clinton-left-super-tease.jpg"", ""description"": ""Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma."", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""title"": ""Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0""}",-5,656,-0.007621951,-15,723.4,-0.020622279,-20.4,732.6,-0.027713012,-11.6,716,-0.015869696,0.013000328,0.020091061,0.008247745,,,,,,,,
Real_49-Webpage,Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked,"Conway: Trump will explain his Islamic State plan if asked

Donald Trump will detail his plan to destroy the Islamic State during Monday night’s debate against Hillary Clinton — if asked, according to his campaign manager.

Asked by Willie Geist during MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Trump will offer specifics beyond his broad statement that he will “knock the hell out of ISIS,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway replied in the affirmative.

Story Continued Below

“He certainly has a plan. I’ve heard it,” Conway said. “This is his debate tonight, Willie, he’ll tell you if that question is asked. But there’s also — you know, people are just amazed that Hillary Clinton would put on her campaign website what her plan to defeat ISIS is. Is it that ISIS can’t read that plan?”

Trump has vowed to “knock the hell out of ISIS” but has been mum on how he would do so, suggesting that he doesn’t want to tip his hand to the terrorist network.

Pressed by Geist and Mika Brzezinski on whether voters deserve to know details about his plan before they cast their votes, or at least a sense that he has any “knowledge of the landscape,” Conway said, “Yes, and he’ll be happy to offer those specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we’re going to do.”

“So just to put a button on it, we’ll get the ISIS plan tonight in the debate?” Geist asked.

“You will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy without telling ISIS particularly, specifically what it’s going to be,” she said.

Real_5-Webpage,Obama in NYC: 'We all have a role to play' in terror fight after suspected bombings,"Story highlights Obams reaffirms US commitment to fighting ISIS

Obama praised the response from citizens in New York and New Jersey

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama worked to calm Americans' jitters Monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists.

During two appearances in New York, Obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. And he urged Americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear.

""I think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values,"" Obama said. ""We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there is no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey.""

""Folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. They are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day. And that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life,"" Obama said. ""That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American.""

The President was speaking Monday morning from a hotel in midtown Manhattan, where he's attending his final United Nations General Assembly meeting. Two miles south, in Chelsea, investigations were still piecing together evidence following a bomb explosion in a dumpster Saturday night, which injured dozens.

Real_51-Webpage,Trump labels Clinton 'weak and ineffective' in wake of bombings,"Story highlights Donald Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for her approach to national security issues

It's a recurring theme of his campaign

Estero, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump, speaking two days after the latest terrorist attack on US soil, sought to paint his rival Hillary Clinton as a ""weak and ineffective"" leader not prepared to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, as he talked up his radical policy prescriptions.

The Republican presidential nominee, addressing more than 8,000 people at his first rally since the bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, talked up his hardline immigration policies, argued domestic terror suspects, even US citizens, should be tried as ""foreign enemy combatants"" -- rather than receive due process under US law.

He also slammed Clinton for what he said was being tougher on his supporters than on Islamist terrorism.

""Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about radical Islamic terrorists,"" Trump said, pointing to Clinton's comments that half his supporters belong in a ""basket of deplorables.""

""Has she ever talked that way about radical Islam? No,"" Trump said. ""Are those words reserved only for hard-working Americans who truly love our country and they want to make a statement? One can be forgiven for getting the impression that these hardworking Americans are somehow a greater threat to our country than these Islamic extremists.""

Real_53-Webpage,Inmate Dead From Alleged Mistreatment In Jail Run By Infamous Pro-Trump Sheriff,"Milwaukee Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. has been a fixture on Fox News in recent months, appearing on multiple programs on that network to attack the Black Lives Matter movement, which he has compared several times to international terrorists.

Clarke has also been an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and is often one of the first names Trump backers bring up when attempting to highlight support for the candidate among black voters. Clarke spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past summer.

But while he was busy on the cable network attacking the black community, a man died in the jail under his command. He reportedly died of thirst, of all things.

Terrill Thomas, 38, was found dead in a Milwaukee County Jail cell on April 24, nine days after being arrested in connection with a shooting. Other inmates heard Thomas beg for water in the days before he died, the Journal Sentinel reported in July. […] Last week the Milwaukee County medical examiner announced that Thomas’ death was due to profound dehydration, according to the Journal Sentinel. By labeling the death a homicide, the medical examiner indicated that it was caused by the actions of another person, although that judgment does not necessarily mean that anyone will be criminally prosecuted in the case.

Inmates at the jail say the water in Thomas’ jail cell had been cut off for 6 days, and that one inmate warned jailers about the danger to the man’s life. Attorney Erik J. Heipt told the site that he has received calls from other inmates to tell him that the water had been cut off to their cells, and another inmate died in 2011 when his water was cut off as well.

Clarke is reportedly part of a pro-Trump bus tour arranged by a super PAC that is supporting the candidate.

The Huffington Post also reports that Clarke took in over $150,000 in 2015 from “speaking fees, travel reimbursements and gifts.”

Real_54-Webpage,Debate Commission STUNS Journalists By Siding With Trump: Fact Checking Is Out Of Bounds (VIDEO),"

16505 SHARES SHARES FacebookTwitter GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr

Former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” To which the head of the Commission on Presidential Debates has officially responded: “Says who?”

In a stunning interview with CNN’s Reliable Sources, Janet Brown gave a baffling explanation for why she believes fact checking should be taken off the table at presidential debates.

“I think personally if you start getting into fact checking, I’m not sure. What is a big fact? What is a little fact? And if you and I have different sources of information does your source about the unemployment rate agree with my source? I don’t think it’s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.”

Head of Commission on Presidential Debates doesn’t want moderators correcting lies because “what is a big fact, what is a little fact?” #cnn pic.twitter.com/krm5FeV9aW — John Aravosis (@aravosis) September 25, 2016

The statement was exactly what the Trump campaign had been demanding for weeks and was ecstatic to hear. Going into Monday’s crucial first presidential debate, the Republican candidate understood that the most dangerous hurdle he had to get around was if the moderator called him on his lies. Trump, who has dismissed preparing for the debate out of hand, lies a lot. That’s his strength. He needs it to win.

Politico recently analyzed Trump’s last five days on the campaign trail and found that Donald Trump lies at a rate of once every 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

Trump’s misrepresentations range from false pronouncements (he again wrongly said he opposed the war in Iraq before it began) to the petty (he insisted Clinton had copied him by holding rallies with her plane in the background and insinuated she was “sleeping” when she held no public events). He contradicted his own policy on providing health care to the poor, overstated the ad-spending discrepancy between his campaign and Clinton’s and exaggerated the size of his primary victories and polling leads.

(For what it’s worth, they also fact-checked Clinton and found that while she, like any politician, does fudge the truth occasionally, Trump’s lying “so greatly exceed[s] Clinton’s as to make the comparison almost ludicrous.” Ouch.)

And while Debate Commissioner Brown used an intentionally vague example (“unemployment rate”), there is no indication that Trump will reserve lies to things so nuanced. One example that might come up: Donald Trump continues to insist that the crime rate in America is going through the roof. This is a blatant lie that is exposed by just quick glance at the FBI’s crime statistics. The debate moderator doesn’t need to serve as the “Encyclopedia Britannica,” he or she just needs to know the basic facts. Big and small. And not let Trump get away with misleading the American people who are tuning in.

Journalists, whose job it is to deal in facts, are furious with this caving to Trump.

If reporters aren't supposed to factcheck at debates, why exactly are reporters moderators to begin with? Why not just have an actor do it? — Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) September 25, 2016

Debate Commission director seems to think there are no facts, just different sources to support any claim. That helps elect President Trump. https://t.co/lPkCQi2KL4 — Mr Media Training (@MrMediaTraining) September 25, 2016

What is the point of a debate moderator other than fact checking? Why is this even a discussion? — Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) September 25, 2016

Meanwhile, Trump’s supporters are actively celebrating. They, just like their candidate, understand that the only path to victory for Trump is if he can get Americans to believe his lies.

@AJDelgado13 Here is a crazy idea…..let the voters at home fact check. Let social media fact check. Candy taught us this. — Judson McCulloch (@JudsonMcCulloch) September 25, 2016

Hint: If you find yourself in a political party that’s major talking point leading up to a debate is that your candidate should be allowed to lie on stage, you might want to consider finding a new political party.

Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of Monday night’s debate when Hillary Clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women.

“I have to say, certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end. I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it’s a presidential virtue,” Conway told MSNBC’s Morning Joe Tuesday. “To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton ‘I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.’ That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.”

Story Continued Below

With just minutes left in Monday night’s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as “a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.” After the debate, Trump told CNN that ““I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton’s husband and daughter in the audience.

Tuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump’s attack might have been.

“I think he could have said what was on millions of Americans’ minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who’s been good to women and who hasn't?” Conway said. “They’re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.”

Overall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a “knockout punch” that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump’s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.

“Donald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that’s fine,” Conway said.

“I don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,” she added. “So I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.”

PARIS — France has apparently become the first country in the world to ban plastic plates, cups and utensils, passing a law that will go into effect in 2020. Exceptions will be allowed for items made of compostable, biosourced materials.

The new law is a part of the country’s Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the same legislation that also outlawed plastic bags in grocery stores and markets beginning in July. Although plastic bags are forbidden in other countries — including in some U.S. states — no country seems to have embraced a plastic ban as sweeping as France’s will be.

The general idea behind the law — following the landmark conference held in Paris last fall on curbing global warming — is to promote a “circular economy” of waste disposal, “from product design to recycling,” French lawmakers say.

[A Maryland county’s nickel tax for plastic bags is paying off, but not as planned]

Objections to plastic as a material are well known. For one, it does not biodegrade and only breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, which pose a significant danger for wildlife that cannot always distinguish it from food sources, particularly in oceans. Aside from ecosystem disruptions, millions of barrels of oil are used every year in manufacturing plastic bags and utensils, playing what environmental activists call a significant role in climate change.

In the words of French President François Hollande, the ban is part of a larger push intended “to make France … an exemplary nation in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, diversifying its energy model and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources” -- starting, it would seem, with the forks and knives distributed at fast-food restaurants and the coffee cups in vending machines.

Not all share the enthusiasm of France’s Socialist government, which has made environmental progress one of its main goals. In Brussels, some argue that the laws violate existing European Union legislation regarding the free movement of goods and the protection of manufacturers.

Eamonn Bates, the secretary general of Pack2Go Europe, a Brussels-based association that represents packaging manufacturers on the continent, told the Associated Press that his organization will challenge France’s ban.

“We are urging the European Commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against France for infringing European law,” he said. “If they don’t, we will.”

Supporters of the ban wanted it to be introduced earlier, possibly as soon as 2017. But Ségolène Royal, the French environment minister, had initially considered it an “anti-social” provision, on the grounds that low-income families relied on plastic utensils and plates.

The ban was then postponed until 2020.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,,https://www.washingtonpost.com,{'$date': 1474243200000},,"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg&w=60,https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png,https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517,https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/,"{""theme"": ""normal"", ""news_keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Washington Post"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste."", ""title"": ""France becomes the first country to ban plastic plates and cutlery"", ""url"": ""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""image"": ""https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-09-12/AP/France_Plastic_Ban-0fe15.jpg?t=20170517"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""referrer"": ""unsafe-url"", ""twitter"": {""site"": ""@WashingtonPost"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image"", ""creator"": ""jameskmcauley""}, ""object-hash"": 1503984085, ""robots"": ""index,follow"", ""apple-itunes-app"": ""app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/19/france-bans-plastic-plates-and-cutlery/"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 500835072, ""app_id"": 41245586762}, ""keywords"": ""Post Keywords"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"", ""description"": ""The ban, to take effect in 2020, is part of a program aimed at making France a model for reducing environmental waste.""}",-14,529,-0.026465028,-1.2,573.6,-0.002341072,-3.6,568.8,-0.006306703,0,563.4,8.47E-05,0.024123956,0.020158325,0.026549718,,,,,,,,
Real_57-Webpage,Paul Ryan ducks on stop-and-frisk,"Story highlights Ryan called for calm in Charlotte, but would not comment on Trump's ""stop and frisk"" proposals

Earlier this week Ryan said he wanted Congress to complete work on a criminal justice reform bill

Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan ducked Thursday on whether he supports the ""stop and frisk"" policy pushed by Donald Trump.

""I don't have an answer for you because it's not something that I've familiarized myself with -- the constitutionality of it, its efficacy, whether (it) worked well in New York City or not,"" Ryan said after being pressed twice by reporters on the policy the GOP nominee wants to revive, despite court rulings finding it unconstitutional.

Ryan called for calm following the shooting in Charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, ""these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting.""

""The loss of any life is a tragedy. The response to that though cannot be more violence. As leaders, it is responsibility to promote calm, peace and dialogue. We cannot allow our nation to be divided up along racial lines and so I hope leaders can come together to find solutions,"" Ryan said.

Real_58-Webpage,Charlotte Police REVEAL What They Said To Black Man Just Moments Before Shooting…,"Charlotte Police REVEAL What They Said To Black Man Just Moments Before Shooting…

There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85.

But all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter.

What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything?

To those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference.

The Blaze posted the statement of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief on the incident.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said.

As an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first? If a man breaks into your house, are you supposed to wait until he actually harms you before you protect yourself? How does that even make sense?

Oh that’s right, it doesn’t. Of course, that doesn’t stop progressives from declaring that they know exactly how things should be happening. You know, with their degrees in women’s studies and art history, they’re clearly the most qualified people to be criticizing the actions of our law enforcement.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/charlotte-police-reveal-said-black-man-just-moments-shooting/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474490291000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-90x90.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343883-featured-214x123.png,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343898-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/truck-driver-890x395_c.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/charlotte-police-reveal-said-black-man-just-moments-shooting/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police.

ORLANDO -- Tim Kaine visited the Pulse night club here on Monday evening, the site where gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 people in June.

The Virginia senator laid flowers at a memorial surrounding the club. He attended alongside former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was injured in a mass shooting in 2011, as well as Giffords's husband astronaut Mark Kelly and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.).

Story Continued Below

""The thing that's painful about this: this is a weird thing to say but I always hoped that Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever,"" Kaine told reporters after a quiet, 10-minute visit to the site. ""As bad as that was, I hoped nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do.""

Kaine was Virginia's governor in 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people at the university.

Later Monday, Kaine, Giffords and Kelly are scheduled to attend a presidential debate watch party with LGBT activists here in Orlando.

Kaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.

Real_6-Webpage,Obama weighs in on the debate,"Obama weighs in on the debate

President Barack Obama hasn't changed his assessment of Donald Trump after Monday night's debate: The GOP nominee, he said on Tuesday, lacks the preparation and temperament for the presidency and can't be trusted to address serious threats like nuclear weapons and climate change.

The president unloaded on Trump during an interview with Ryan Seacrest in the wake of Trump's showdown with Hillary Clinton, which he watched from the Treaty Room of the White House.

Story Continued Below

Obama touted Clinton’s performance and her qualifications for the presidency, saying “she’s serious and does her homework.”

And he blasted Trump for not having the “preparations and the temperament or the core values of inclusion and making everybody, you know, have opportunities that would take our country forward.”

The president said his two biggest concerns for his daughters’ generation are the spread of nuclear weapons and the onset of climate change — adding that Trump falls short on both.

""I get worried when I hear somebody like Donald Trump start saying, 'Well, I don't necessarily know whether Japan or Korea should be protected by us. Maybe they should get their own nuclear weapons.' That shows somebody who doesn't pay attention to these issues, and you don't necessarily want close to the nuclear button,” Obama said. (Trump objected to a similar characterization of his views on East Asia during Monday's debate, saying it was ""wrong."")

Obama also took a shot at Trump for suggesting, in a November 2012 tweet, that climate change is a hoax created by China.

The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012

""When you hear somebody like Trump say he thinks this is a plot by the Chinese, that this is a fraud and a hoax, when 99 percent of scientists are saying you've got to do something about it,"" Obama said, ""that worries me.""

Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said in a TV interview on Tuesday that he believes climate change is ""naturally occurring.""

Real_60-Webpage,How Trump Is Hiding From The Media Like A Total Coward,"Donald Trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests. He is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face, and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate.

But lately, as Trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel, he has also been in something of a retreat. That is, Trump is only talking to Fox News right now.

Trump is saying “yes” to Fox News almost every day but saying “no” to most other major networks and news organizations — a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee. He called into “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning, he is booked on “The O’Reilly Factor” Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday. Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate’s exposure to hard-hitting questions — while fueling frustration among journalists.

At Fox News, Trump can avoid pesky follow-up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy, long after he claims to have dropped it. Fox News hosts won’t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right, rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement. At Fox News, Trump isn’t challenged – and that’s the way he wants it.

The problem is, wrapping up in the Fox News cocoon may feel good for the time being, but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort. Trump isn’t reaching out.

It is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign, where instead of following the model of successful politicians like George W. Bush and President Obama by holding campaign rallies in “swing” districts hoping to persuade voters, Trump has rallies with the converted.

On election day in 2012, Fox News viewers were shocked to find the Romney “landslide” the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality. They may be setting themselves up for a major failure.

Her campaign’s plan was to lay low, out of the spotlight, make little to no contact with the press, and just let Donald Trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention.

But now that the post-DNC honeymoon is over, they have to come back to reality and see that the election isn’t over, and that they had grossly underestimated Donald Trump and his campaign. Add to that Hillary’s frequent, inconvenient health episodes, and now even some Democrats are talking about a “Plan B.”

For the past few weeks, the poll numbers have closed in, with Donald Trump taking the lead in several key battleground states.

Now, even Hillary is asking why she isn’t “50 points ahead” of Trump?

At a campaign event in Las Vegas, Hillary video conferenced in to address the Labor International Union of North America. While she was talking about “investing in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and collective bargaining,” she raised the question:

“Having said all this, ‘Why aren’t I 50 points ahead?’ you might ask? Well, the choice for working families has never been clearer. I need your help to get Donald Trump’s record out to everybody. Nobody should be fooled.”

At another point in her speech, she encouraged her supporters to “stage an intervention” if they know anyone who supports Trump. “If you do know somebody who might be voting for Trump, stage an intervention,” she said. “Try to talk some sense into them. Lay out the facts. The facts are on our side, about what I’ve done versus what he’s done. Remember, friends don’t let friends vote for Trump.”

Real_62-Webpage,Bobby Knight: Nobody can 'correct mistakes' like Trump,"Bobby Knight: Nobody can 'correct mistakes' like Trump

Over the course of his 75 years on and off the basketball court, Bobby Knight said Wednesday that he has never met anyone who can fix mistakes quite like Donald Trump.

""There’s nobody that I’ve met in my lifetime that has a better grasp of how to correct mistakes and how to look at what’s wrong and how to correct what’s wrong and how to get it going right,"" Knight told an audience in Toledo, Ohio, his home state. ""And I think that is the most important thing that can be brought to the next president of the United States. And there’s nobody who has a better background in correcting things that are going wrong and getting things going in the right direction and developing those things — the best person ever has been Donald Trump.""

Story Continued Below

Back on the campaign trail with Trump after several months, Knight extolled the Republican nominee as ""not just an American; he’s a world figure.""

""He’s known all over the world. Donald Trump put a lot of businesses together,"" the coach continued. ""United States around the world. A lot of businesses. Created a lot of jobs, thousands of jobs for people around the world.""

And Trump, Knight later indicated, is the person for the White House.

""Believe me when I tell you, I think you’re all gonna agree on this: Our next president is gonna inherit a hell of a lot of problems, and it’s gonna take a problem solver to get us back where we want to be and where we should be, and there is no one that even comes close to being smart, tough and dedicated completely to the United States of America,"" Knight said. He noted that the next president would have to deal with the national debt, ""immigration problems and on and on.""

Remarking on his study of history, Knight said that he had come to the conclusion that ""when I need somebody on my side to help us with problems, he's the first man I want to choose and the first man I want to see.""

Knight, clad in a red, white and blue gingham shirt, acknowledged to the crowd that he doesn't ""dress as well as politicians dress, but I want you to know, and it’s for all of you folks, I wore my red, white and blue shirt today.""

""And I think that when you leave, I hope you all go out and buy a red, white and blue shirt, because it’s indicative of your love for the greatest country in the world, the United States,"" Knight said.

First a pipe bomb exploded on the Jersey Shore, then New York was next. Now, pipe bombs have been found in a New Jersey train station. According to the New York Daily News, “authorities discovered three pipe bombs and two smaller devices at a train station in Elizabeth.”

Since all of these bombs have been found in a relatively small area, it seems likely that a small team or even a single individual is behind it. Although Islamic terrorism would seem to be the most likely explanation, there have been “mad bombers” who’ve done this sort of thing before (See Ted Kaczynski & George Metesky).

Is their motive simply to cause terror? Are they trying to create mass casualties, but failing to do so? We don’t know yet. However, the FBI has arrested 5 people they believe may be connected to the Chelsea bombing investigation.

That being said, none of these people have been charged, which could mean they’re collecting evidence or alternately, these people may end up having nothing to do with the case.

Real_64-Webpage,Hillary Clinton on Between Two Ferns: 'I really regret doing this',"Story highlights The interview is part of the Clinton campaign's attempt to show a funnier, softer side

President Barack Obama also sat down with Zach Galifianakis to tout the Affordable Care Act

(CNN) Hillary Clinton sat down for an interview with the irreverent Zach Galifianakis and almost immediately -- albeit jokingly -- regretted it.

Clinton sat down with the comedian on September 9, the day her doctor diagnosed her with pneumonia. Clinton, who was introduced as ""Had Pneumonia"" at the start of the video , plays along with Galifianakis' off-color humor and shows a bit of comedy herself.

""When you see how well it works for Donald Trump, do you think to yourself, oh maybe I should be more racist,"" the comedian asks Clinton, who just shakes her head and laughs.

Galifianakis also knocks Clinton for going to Trump's 2005 wedding to Melania Trump.

""When you went to Donald Trump's wedding, did he write his own vows? And did Michelle Obama write Melania's,"" the comedian says, a joke about how Trump's wife plagiarized the first lady in her speech to the Republican National Convention.

Magistrate won't order federal arraignment for bombing suspect

A federal magistrate has turned down a request from defense lawyers that the man accused of the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey be immediately arraigned on a set of federal charges he is facing.

Manhattan-based U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein agreed with federal prosecutors that suspect Ahmad Rahami need not have an initial federal court appearance until he is taken into federal custody. And, by all appearances, he's currently in the custody of local officials in New Jersey, the magistrate said.

""The [federal] Government explicitly denies that it has arrested the defendant. There is no evidence to the contrary,"" Gorenstein wrote in a two-page order released Wednesday evening.

Gorenstein noted that defense lawyers said ""it is undisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning"" Rahami.

""In fact, this question is very much in dispute,"" the magistrate wrote. ""The Government asserts unequivocally that the defendant 'is not in federal custody ... Whether there are federal authorities questioning defendant does not address the issue of custody. At this point, the Court has no evidence whatsoever from anyone with personal knowledge that the defendant is being detained by any federal officer.""

The magistrate also rejected defense lawyers' claims that a federal court rule requires Rahami be promptly arraigned on the federal charges even if he is arrested by state authorities.

Gorenstein not only declined to schedule a court appearance for Rahami, who's at a Newark hospital and could have been arraigned there, but said he lacks authority to appoint the court's indigent defense providers at the Federal Defenders of New York to formally represent Rahami.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday morning that Rahami will be brought to New York City in the ""near future"" to face the federal complaint there, which is expected to take precedence over attempted murder charges filed in county court in New Jersey and another federal complaint in the Garden State.

A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office declined to comment on the decision, saying the ruling could speak for itself.

The defense attorney who asked for the arraignment, James Patton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the magistrate’s decision.

Real_66-Webpage,US: ISIS did not use mustard agent in base attack,"Story highlights A final lab test of ISIS weapon fired on US troops tested negative for mustard agent

US forces were fired on last week by ISIS, initial tests showed a chemical weapon was used

Washington (CNN) The American-led military coalition against ISIS said Tuesday that a final laboratory test of the weapon ISIS fired at a US-Iraqi base in northern Iraq last week did not contain a mustard agent as earlier believed.

Col. John Dorrian, a spokesperson for the anti-ISIS coalition, tweeted that ""definitive"" lab results show the munitions that hit Qayyara air base on September 20 was not a chemical weapon.

Definitive lab tests conclude: No mustard agent present in munitions fired at Qayyarah West AB Sept 20. #Daesh #ISIL — OIR Spokesman (@OIRSpox) September 27, 2016

Initial field tests of what has been described as either a rocket or artillery shell did indeed test positive for the chemical weapon and US personnel were required to undergo decontamination.

Last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""we assess it to be a sulfur mustard blister agent"" when asked about the attack.

Military officials had told CNN that a second test of the weapon had produced negative results while a third lab test was inconclusive. The most recent test announced by Dorrian represents the final test of the weapon.

Real_67-Webpage,"Terrorist Attacks Will Likely Affect 2016 Presidential Race, Experts Say","The recent connected bombings in New York and New Jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in Minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security.

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have spoken out since the attacks, which left dozens of people injured.

John Cohen, a former counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign ""have a significant impact"" on voters.

""When events occur like this ... you tend to have people become more fearful, and when people are more fearful, they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong,"" said Cohen, who currently works as an ABC News consultant.

Three of the latest national polls — all conducted before the attacks this weekend — had Clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism.

In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sept. 11, Clinton led, 50 percent to Trump's 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to Trump's 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism.

A CBS/New York Times poll released Sept. 14 had Clinton doing ""a better job handling terrorism and national security"" according to 49 percent of respondents, compared with Trump's 45 percent.

The split was closest in a Quinnipiac poll released Sept. 15, in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism, ""regardless of how you intend to vote."" In that poll, Clinton got 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent.

""Traditionally, it's been the Republican Party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security, but today that's kind of flipped because, despite his rhetoric, there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that Donald Trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats,"" Cohen said.

Current events are factoring into the political campaigns, with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks. But Cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves.

He said Trump's rhetoric and calls to bar foreign Muslims from entering the United States ""may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on [ISIS'] behalf.""

James Campbell, a professor of political science at the University at Buffalo in New York who has written a book about political polarization, told ABC News that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for Trump.

""I have to think that terrorist events in this country help Trump and hurt Clinton. For these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem,"" he said.

""It may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism, an approach associated with Trump. When suspects are identified who have Muslim-sounding names, then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny,"" Campbell added.",http://abcn.ws/2cDjJ92,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg,"More Meghan,Abc News",http://abcn.ws,,,"http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Manhattan_Explosion7_ml_160919_1_4x3_992.jpg,http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_12x5_992.jpg,http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript,http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997,"{""fb_title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""copyright"": ""Copyright (c) 2017 ABC News Internet Ventures"", ""author"": ""ABC News"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""ABC News"", ""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Reaction to attacks may not be the same as normal, however."", ""title"": ""Terrorist Attacks Likely to Affect 2016 Race, Experts Say"", ""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""image"": ""http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/AP_Explosion3_ml_160919_1_16x9_992.jpg"", ""creator"": ""@mkeneally"", ""site"": ""@ABC"", ""app"": {""url"": {""ipad"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""iphone"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""googleplay"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""name"": {""ipad"": ""ABC News"", ""iphone"": ""ABC News"", ""googleplay"": ""ABC News""}, ""id"": {""ipad"": 306934135, ""iphone"": 300255638, ""googleplay"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}}, ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""robots"": ""index, follow"", ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19"", ""al"": {""ipad"": {""url"": ""abcnewsipad://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 380520716, ""app_name"": ""ABC News for iPad""}, ""web"": {""url"": ""http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997""}, ""android"": {""url"": ""android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/terrorist-attacks-impact-2016-presidential-race-experts/story?id=42192997"", ""app_name"": ""ABC News Breaking Latest News"", ""package"": ""com.abc.abcnews""}, ""iphone"": {""url"": ""abcnewsiphone://link/story,42192997"", ""app_store_id"": 300255638, ""app_name"": ""ABC News - Breaking US & World News""}}, ""Date"": ""2016-09-19"", ""fb"": {""admins"": 704409894, ""app_id"": 4942312939, ""pages"": 55845270277}, ""Last-Modified"": ""2016-09-19 18:04:32"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"", ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"", ""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, 2016, presidential race""}",6,604,0.009933775,1.2,649.6,0.001815613,4.4,634.6,0.006619154,2.8,639.2,0.004425628,0.008118162,0.003314621,0.005508147,,,,,,,,

When is the first general election presidential debate?

The first general election presidential debate of 2016 will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on Sept. 26.

Story Continued Below

What time is the debate and how long is it?

The debate will start at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time and run for 90 minutes without commercial breaks.

How can I watch the debate?

It will be broadcast on all of the major television networks, as well as the websites for major cable news channels and C-SPAN.

Who will participate in the debate?

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump. No other candidates qualified.

Who will moderate the debate?

Lester Holt, who anchors ""NBC Nightly News,"" will be the moderator. It’s his second time serving in that role in the 2016 presidential cycle. Holt was also a moderator for the Democratic primary debate on January 17. On February 15, 2015 Holt became the substitute anchor of NBC Nightly News after Brian Williams was suspended. Four months later he became the permanent anchor.

What is the format of the debate?

The debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes each. Each segment will start with a question from Holt, after which each candidates will have two minutes for an initial response and then will be allowed to respond to each other. On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the tentative topics for the debate: “America's direction,” “achieving prosperity,” and “securing America.” The topics are subject to change based on news developments, according to the commission.

Why aren't Jill Stein or Gary Johnson participating in the debate?

Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein were not invited by the presidential debate commission. The commission said it would only invite candidates that averaged 15 percent in five national polls it selected. Neither Johnson nor Stein made that threshold.

What's at stake for Hillary Clinton?

The debate is Clinton’s chance to turn the page on a few weeks during which Trump has eaten much of the polling lead she built following her convention. Clinton’s camp has also been counting on her policy knowledge and debate experience to help her expose Trump’s weaknesses, but the Democratic candidate also comes in facing higher expectations than Trump.

What's at stake for Donald Trump?

Trump has been accused lacking policy gravitas and self-restraint, and both of those perceived weaknesses could be exposed in a debate, where candidates will be grilled on their familiarity with issues foreign and domestic and be expected to keep composed under rhetorical assault from their opponents. Trump has the advantage, however, of low expectations: At several turns in the presidential campaign, even modest pivots away from his bombastic primary style were hailed as pivots to professionalism, and a similar self-restraint — provided he still hits the high notes his supporters are expected — could help him clear the low bar again.

What is the most watched debate in presidential history?

In 1980 the debate between President Jimmy Carter and Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan garnered a viewership of 80.6 million people, the largest television audience for a debate since Nielsen Ratings began collecting viewership data in 1976. In 2012, the first general election presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney attracted about 70 million viewers.

What's the most-watched television moment of all time?

Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 on NBC is currently the most watched television program in U.S. history, attracting 114 million viewers, according to NBC News. The New England Patriots played against the Seattle Seahawks, winning the game 28-24.

Still, that pales in comparison to the estimated 600 million people worldwide who watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first moon landing on July 20, 1969, or the estimated 750 million people worldwide that watched Prince Charles of Wales marry Lady Diana Spencer on July 29, 1981.

Federal prosecutors are pushing back against a demand by defense lawyers that New York and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami be arraigned immediately on federal charges he is facing.

Late Tuesday, defense attorneys wrote to federal magistrate judge Gabriel Gorenstein asking that Rahami be promptly informed of the charges against him at a court proceeding that would also formally advise him of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent.

However, prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a letter to the magistrate Wednesday that Rahami isn't in federal custody so there is no legal obligation for the federal courts to get involved.

""The defendant in this case, Ahmad Khan Rahami, a/k/a 'Ahmad Rahimi,' has not been arrested on any federal charge. He is not in federal custody. He is in the custody of the State of New Jersey, on state charges, and is subject to a bail package issued by the New Jersey state court,"" federal prosecutors wrote. ""While a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum has been lodged with the United States Marshals Service, it has not been executed, and there has been no such federal arrest.""

The writ referred to in the federal prosecutors' letter would require state or local officials to hand over Rahami to federal authorities for prosecution. Rahami is facing five attempted murder charges in a New Jersey court in connection with a shootout Monday morning in which the suspect and two police officers were wounded. Rahami is currently in a Newark hospital. A judge has set $5.2 million bail and an initial county court appearance for Sept. 28.

Defense lawyers contend that Rahami has been ""without the benefit of counsel"" since his arrest, but it's unclear whether he's been advised of his Miranda rights or whether he's made some decision not to meet with an attorney. Lawmakers briefed on the investigation say he has not been cooperating.

While Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday that Rahami would be taken to Manhattan in the ""near future,"" the letter from prosecutors evinces no urgency to such a move. Prosecutors say Rahami has no rights in the federal system at the moment, including a right to counsel.

The letter indicates that lawyers from the Federal Defenders office in New York have sought appointment in Rahami's case, but prosecutors say that's ""plainly premature"" until he is brought to court. Prosecutors cited a series of terrorism cases where judges ruled defendants were not entitled to court-appointed counsel until they appear in court.

Court records show no immediate action from Gorenstein on the request for Rahami's arraignment or the defense lawyers' request to be appointed as his counsel in the case.

Real_7-Webpage,Donald Trump's rise puts Ted Cruz in a bind,"Story highlights Ted Cruz refused to endorse Trump earlier this year, but is under pressure to change his mind now

Cruz could face a primary challenge in 2018 from a fellow Republican

Washington (CNN) Rep. Trent Franks backed Ted Cruz during the GOP presidential primary, but he now has a message for the Texas Republican: Get in line behind Donald Trump.

""Any person in this party that does not support Trump at this point is increasing the chances of Hillary Clinton becoming president and destroying the Constitution,"" Franks said.

JUST WATCHED Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cruz: I won't support those who attack my wife 01:51

On the other side, Cruz backers say that the first-term senator should stick to his guns and withhold an endorsement -- or risk angering his own supporters who detest Trump.

""I have five rules for political endorsements,"" said Steve Deace, an Iowa radio talk show host who was an outspoken Cruz backer during the primary. ""And Cruz endorsing Trump violates every single one of them.""

Less than two months until Election Day, Trump has once again put Cruz in a bind. As Trump's poll numbers rise and now is neck-and-neck against Clinton, the GOP nominee's backers are looking for every last ounce of support to showcase that there is momentum and energy behind his campaign. If Trump falls short of Clinton by a narrow margin, Trump's backers are bound to blame holdouts like Cruz for failing to do more to help their party.

Real_70-Webpage,Trump hits Clinton on Islamic State: ‘It is time for change’,"“Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” Donald Trump tweets. | AP Photo Trump hits Clinton on Islamic State: ‘It is time for change’

Donald Trump called for a change Tuesday in how the U.S. handles the terror threat of the Islamic State, a shift away from President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies.

“Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.”

Story Continued Below

Following a series of planted bombs in New York and New Jersey over the weekend and a stabbing in Minnesota, Trump on Monday hammered Clinton on her record amid increasing concerns regarding the terrorist network and the threat of domestic attacks.

The real estate mogul again blamed Clinton and Obama for refusing to utter the words “radical Islamic terrorism” and accused them of emboldening terrorists across the globe.

“Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,” he said in a statement Monday, adding that terrorists are “hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.”

Trump vowed to “bring an end to these senseless acts of violence” and condemned the White House, whose spokesman referred to the battle against the Islamic State as a “narrative fight.”

“They are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives,’” Trump said. “These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life.”

Real_71-Webpage,Bridgegate: Port Authority officials planned to make Fort Lee 'traffic jam as bad as possible',"Newark (CNN) Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.

David Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign.

Wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.

Wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone.""

On August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.""

""Got it,"" Wildstein responded.

A phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.

""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.

Wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.

Wildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.

This ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.

Wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.

Baroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.

Wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.

On Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.

Bob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess.""

Wildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.

""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office.

Wildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns.

Wildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie.

All of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.

On the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.

""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified.

A Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.

Wildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased.""

Several calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned.

Last week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests.

Wildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.

Kelly and Baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with Bridgegate. Their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own defenses.",http://cnn.it/2dn8vWp,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160719214618-chris-christie-rnc-super-tease.jpg,Dominique Debucquoy-dodley,http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160719214618-chris-christie-rnc-super-tease.jpg,http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160802200536-chris-christie-august-2-2016-exlarge-169.jpg",http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/26/politics/bridgegate-chris-christie-port-authority-fort-lee/index.html,"{""description"": ""Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov.

Donald Trump is the antithesis of the United States, according to U2 frontman Bono, who called the Republican presidential nominee “potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America.”

“Look, America is like the best idea the world ever came up with,” Bono, whose real name is Paul David Hewson, told “CBS This Morning” in an interview broadcast Tuesday. “But Donald Trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America. Potentially.”

Bono pointed to nations like Ireland and Great Britain as great countries but suggested that America is different because it’s an idea, one that Trump is “trying to hijack.”

“That idea is bound up in justice and equality for all — equality and justice for all, you know,” he continued. “I think he’s hijacked the party. I think he’s trying to hijack the idea of America. And I think it’s bigger than all of us. I think it’s — it’s — this is really dangerous.”

Real_73-Webpage,2016 presidential race tightens in Florida,"Story highlights The campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are both targeting Florida

It's living up to its reputation as a perennial swing state

(CNN) Florida -- a perennial swing state -- is living up to its reputation ahead of the November election.

A CNN/ORC poll last week found Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump almost evenly matched.

The survey among likely voters gave Trump 47% to Clinton's 44% -- with a 3.5% margin of error -- wiping out Clinton's bump following the Democratic convention in August. With 50 days until the election, Florida political experts say it's anyone's guess who will come out on top in the Sunshine State.

""So if I had to call it today, it would simply be, flip a coin,"" says USF Tampa political scientist Susan MacManus, a distinguished professor at the University of South Florida. ""We're to the point where anything is possible. This is just one of those kind of elections.""

All eyes are on central Florida's I-4 corridor, historically responsible for swinging elections in either direction. The area stretching from Tampa to Daytona Beach is diverse in politics, age, racial make-up and social economics.

Real_74-Webpage,HuffPo Just Dropped The Mic On Internet Polls Saying Trump Crushed Hillary In Last Night’s Debate,"The earliest actual poll to come out of last night’s debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate. However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide. How can that be?

Here’s The Huffington Post to answer that question:

Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday’s debate? — Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016

Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary? Because this shows how online polls are meaningless. CNN actually contacted people. Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll. The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outlet’s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.

There’s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last night’s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.

Of course, the Trumpkins aren’t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:

@HuffingtonPost someone’s upset that #Trumpwins — Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys? — Timothy j. sims (@Timothyjsims2) September 27, 2016

@HuffingtonPost Please vote Hillary or else Bill Clinton will do things to me ? pic.twitter.com/CsOON8nF3Y — Pneumonia WarMachine (@z3no_of_citium) September 27, 2016

And, obviously, we can always count on Trump himself to only tout the polls that say he won, because anything that doesn’t show him as the winner, as the god he wants to be, is biased and unfair, and, well, who cares about those outlets anyway:

I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate – except for the little watched @CNN poll. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

Such a great honor. Final debate polls are in – and the MOVEMENT wins!#AmericaFirst #MAGA #ImWithYouhttps://t.co/3KWOl2ibaW pic.twitter.com/sfCEE3I5pF — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

He tweeted a story from the Daily Mail, too, that carries a headline saying, “Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN’s overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.” They actually looks like they’re calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence.

Self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear. Hillary won.

Real_75-Webpage,Tim Kaine on Libertarian ticket: 'Everybody knows they're not going to win',"Story highlights Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine says third-party Libertarian candidates will lose

He acknowledged that he and Clinton will make a case to voters who may be considering Johnson

(CNN) Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine has a message for voters considering a third-party candidate: They're going to lose.

""The argument against the ticket is, I think, everybody knows that they're not going to win,"" Kaine said of the Gary Johnson and Bill Weld Libertarian ticket in an interview with Yahoo News' Katie Couric this week.

Hillary Clinton's running mate pointed to the 2000 election as evidence that a protest vote for a third-party candidate can affect the outcome of the race -- and history.

""My argument against the (Johnson-Weld) ticket is the Al Gore-George W. Bush race in 2000. The third party candidacy of Ralph Nader cost Gore electoral votes in New Hampshire and Florida. And if Gore had been president, we probably wouldn't had a war in Iraq,"" he said. ""Casting a vote, a protest vote, for a third-party candidate that's going to lose may well affect the outcome. It may well lead to a consequence that is deeply, deeply troubling. That's not a speculation, we've seen it in our country's history.""

Real_76-Webpage,Watch Joe Biden Take Trump’s Own Words And Tear Him To SHREDS After Debate (VIDEO),"If there’s anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesn’t mince words, and will say what needs to be said, it’s Vice President Joe Biden.

While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Monday’s debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it’s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.

Biden said:

“This is a guy who said — and wants to be president — that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?”

Adding:

“Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we’re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.”

Then really getting to the core of it, he said:

“He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don’t take pleasure from ‘You’re fired.’ They don’t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.”

Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don’t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage.

“He acknowledged that he didn’t pay taxes because, he said, he’s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who’s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.”

Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates:

“If this choice isn’t clear, I don’t know –- my lord… What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.”

And it’s true, the choice is abundantly clear — Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.

Watch Biden lay into Trump here:

Real_77-Webpage,U.S. mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrants,"The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general said that 858 people who were ordered to be deported or removed instead eventually received citizenship. | AP Photo U.S. mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrants

At least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general announced Monday.

The mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.

Story Continued Below

The discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.

The inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only ""potentially"" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship.

""It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,"" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. ""Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.""

In at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.

“This situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,” Inspector General John Roth said. “To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.”

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”

Real_79-Webpage,Donald Trump Jr. Just Pinned A Tweet So Stupid It Will Make Your Eyes Bleed ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

Donald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it’s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.

Together, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we’ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.

Today’s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.

For the left, it’s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let’s not forget that it’s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.

For years, we’ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche’s Twitter account this morning, I couldn’t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:

Clearly when you’re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When “liberals” — otherwise known as “sane people” — try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we’re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It’s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.

The Supreme Court has sided with those “liberals” every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I’ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I’ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.

Real_80-Webpage,Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground,"Donald Trump's reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date.

Trump is saying ""yes"" to Fox News almost every day but saying ""no"" to most other major networks and news organizations -- a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee.

He called into ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday morning, he is booked on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" Monday night, and he has another town hall with Sean Hannity coming up on Wednesday.

Rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for Trump. If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.

Trump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true.

Newt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying ""she doesn't do press conferences."" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning.

These sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July.

Trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought — especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point.

""It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,"" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday.

Trump's recent TV appearances, on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" and ""The Tonight Show,"" made news, but not in journalistic settings.

The Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago.

Trump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that ""it didn't go very well"" for Trump.

""It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd — or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier — and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,"" Borchers wrote afterwards.

Trump's last time on NBC was the ""Commander in Chief Forum"" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump.

Related: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was ""disaster""

The candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a ""60 Minutes"" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17.

Trump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.

TV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.

This accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps.

""Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,"" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources."" ""You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed.""

Diamond said ""he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point.""

Trump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be ""trying to reach a a broader general election audience.""

""However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,"" Bonjean said. ""Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience.""

This conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. ""He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,"" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday.

Trump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.

According to TVNewser, Wednesday's town hall will focus on ""issues and concerns surrounding African-Americans this election cycle.""

According to Nielsen data, only 1.5% of Hannity's 2 million nightly viewers are African American. Overall, at any given time of day, about 2% of Fox News viewers are African American.",http://cnn.it/2dcjQUU,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-780x439.jpg,Brian Stelter,http://cnn.it,,,"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150529102155-anheuser-busch-drinking-water-124x70.jpg,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/authors/byline-icon/brian-stelter.png,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/9.0/sections/media/cnnmedia_color.svg,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170828124254-hurricane-harvey-damage-124x70.jpg,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160531165528-donald-trump-media-1024x576.png,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/images/1.gif,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif,https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=731697573629176&ev=PageView&noscript=1,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/logos/cnn-logo.png,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170828120549-whole-foods-price-drop-bananas-124x70.jpg,http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-780x439.jpg,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/sections/media/reliable-sources-cnnmoney.png,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/logos/money-logo.png,http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/video/bvp/images/1.gif",http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/19/media/donald-trump-fox-news-interviews-press-conferences/index.html,"{""news_keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Fox News, media"", ""title"": ""Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""CNNMoney"", ""description"": ""Trump is saying \""yes\"" to Fox News almost every day but saying \""no\"" to most other news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential party nominee."", ""title"": ""Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground"", ""url"": ""http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/19/media/donald-trump-fox-news-interviews-press-conferences/index.html"", ""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-780x439.jpg"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""section"": ""media"", ""author"": ""Brian Stelter"", ""vr"": {""category"": ""media"", ""type"": ""Article""}, ""DC.date.issued"": ""2016-09-19T06:44:21"", ""keywords"": ""Donald Trump, Fox News, media"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 521848191196480}, ""date"": ""2016-09-19 06:44:21"", ""twitter"": {""description"": ""Trump is saying \""yes\"" to Fox News almost every day but saying \""no\"" to most other news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential party nominee."", ""title"": ""Donald Trump retreats to friendly media ground"", ""url"": ""http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/19/media/donald-trump-fox-news-interviews-press-conferences/index.html"", ""image"": ""http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160919130858-trump-hannity-540x304.jpg"", ""site"": ""@CNNMoney"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""viewport"": ""width=1140"", ""description"": ""Trump is saying \""yes\"" to Fox News almost every day but saying \""no\"" to most other news organizations \u2014 a highly unusual strategy for a presidential party nominee.""}",15,918,0.016339869,18,734.2,0.024621993,19.6,731.8,0.026641732,29.4,801.6,0.036603705,0.008282124,0.010301863,0.020263835,,,,,,,,
Real_81-Webpage,Pence gives no specifics on why Trump Foundation story is inaccurate,"Pence gives no specifics on why Trump Foundation story is inaccurate

When it comes to the Trump campaign's allegations of ""inaccuracies and omissions"" against a Washington Post story, running mate Mike Pence struggled late Tuesday night to account for specific examples.

Appearing on MSNBC's ""The 11th Hour with Brian Williams"" after an evening rally in Williamsburg, Virginia, the Indiana governor backed up the Trump campaign's statement against the Post's reporting earlier in the day that Donald Trump spent $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle legal issues.

Story Continued Below

""Well, I think what we found is that there is a number of factual errors in that story as there were in previous stories about the Trump Foundation. I'm confident they'll be able to address those and demonstrate that they fully complied with the law,"" Pence told Brian Williams, adding that the ""larger issue"" is the Clinton Foundation.

Williams tried to button up the issue, pressing Pence specifically for ""what the factual errors are that the campaign is alleging"" from the latest Post story.

""Well, I think the foundation will be able to lay those out. There were errors in the previous Washington Post stories, and, you know, look, you know me a while, Brian. I strongly support a free and independent press. People are entitled to ask questions, and I'm sure the Trump Foundation and the Trump family will continue to be able to answer those questions.""

Pence's comments and the Trump campaign statement came hours after the latest article from the Post into the Republican nominee's charitable foundation.

Real_82-Webpage,Details Emerge About NYC Bomb Suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami,"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge.

The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.

New Jersey State Police

A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.

Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.

One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.

Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.

New Jersey State Police

The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.

""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.""

Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.

Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

New Jersey State Police

In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted.

Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.

Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.

A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.

Real_83-Webpage,Trump’s puzzling pitch to black voters,"CLEVELAND — Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.

It was just another day in Trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.

Story Continued Below

The effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.""

On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King — who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a “gladiator.” King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.

“The system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” King said.

After the church event, Trump sat for a “town hall” with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.

“We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,” Trump said.

Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office.

But even before Trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark Tuesday night.

“I don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,” Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. “Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?”

Trump’s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “What do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences.

At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.

Seated to Trump’s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (“there’s only one,” Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (“tough”), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (“a tough general”) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with Trump’s black outreach.

“I’m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,” Trump said from the pulpit.

Trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.

""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?”

King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.

King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.

“Every white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,” said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.

“I told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro — I would use the N-word — but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,” King said.

When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “Ah, there’s only one Don King.”

Before King, Cohen, Trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of Trump as a “racist.”

“The word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” Cohen complained. “I’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It’s disgraceful.”

Cohen said, “Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.”

Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t.

“They come and they take your vote,” Trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”

Donald Trump finally acknowledged President Barack Obama’s American birthplace last week, but one of his supporters, controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, sees a silver lining for the ""birther"" movement: Trump didn't take a position on whether Obama’s birth certificate was forged.

“If he says the president was born here, maybe he has information I don’t have,” Arpaio told POLITICO of the GOP nominee's statement. “He didn’t say the document was legitimate. He didn’t go that route.”

Story Continued Below

Of Trump’s statement on Obama’s birthplace, Arpaio added: “It didn’t bother me.”

Arpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.

Trump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States — a claim the president’s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.

But while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama’s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that “we are looking at a forged document. Period.”

On Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing “to say it’s a legitimate document.”

Arpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president’s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.

Still, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.

“I have no idea now where he was born,” Arpaio said. “You hear a lot of stories.”

He and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said.

“I didn’t know he was going to say it,” he said.

Real_85-Webpage,Barack Obama at Benjamin Netanyahu meeting: 'He is always very candid with us',"Story highlights Obama has taken steps toward solidifying the alliance with Israel this month

His meeting with Netanyahu was likely to be their last face-to-face consultations

New York (CNN) President Barack Obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships Wednesday during a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before Obama leaves office.

Speaking before their session, Obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency.

""Our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,"" Obama said. ""These are challenging times. One thing that I would say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us.""

That candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between Obama and his Israeli counterpart, whom the White House has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama's 30-minute meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the Oval Office in January.

Obama is intent on conferring solid ties with Israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and Netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail.

Real_86-Webpage,McAuliffe hangs with Willie Nelson -- and his weed,"Story highlights Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was photographed with Willie Nelson, and Nelson's marijuana

Nelson was in Bristow Saturday for a Farm Aid 2016 concert

(CNN) Hanging out with Willie Nelson over the weekend has left a cloud around Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, after a photo of McAuliffe and the legendary marijuana-loving musician tweeted by Nelson's wife, Annie Nelson, included a can of ""Willie's Reserve"" -- Nelson's brand of weed.

It's sold in Colorado and is legal in Washington, but not Virginia -- a reality Annie Nelson might have been alluding to when she captioned the picture: """"UH-OH Trouble!""

McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the Democratic governor has never used drugs in his life -- and isn't cool enough to know what Willie's Reserve is.

""He was not and still is not aware of whatever was on the table or anywhere around him and wouldn't know marijuana or related paraphernalia if it walked up and shook his hand,"" Coy said. ""He's cool, but he's not that cool.""

The newspaper's political reporter, Graham Moomaw, tweeted a zoomed-in photo of the can of Willie's Reserve weed, next to a pair of glasses and a remote control.

Real_88-Webpage,It’s “Trump is HITLER” Month at the Washington Post – Eagle Rising,"Like much of the mainstream media, the Washington Post is going out of its way to disparage Donald Trump. But the Post isn’t satisfied with the normal biased reporting—they have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the Republican nominee. That must have failed because now they are taking the lazy, but disgusting way out with inappropriate Hitler references. Twice in this month Post columnists have compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Perhaps the editors have designated September as “Trump Is Hitler Month” at the Washington Post.

On Monday they featured a column by Richard Cohen which said in part,

(…) while Trump is neither an anti-Semite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries, he is Hitlerian in his thinking. He thinks the truth is what he says it is.

Mr. Cohen didn’t mention what despot Hillary’s lies reminded him of, but then again the post would never have a “Hillary is Hitler month.” While a Hillary comparison would be just as wrong, the fact that they are only creating a “Trump” month is incredibly sexist.

Six Day’s before Mr. Cohen, another columnist Shalom Auslander wrote, “Don’t compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. It belittles…

Real_9-Webpage,"Georgia poll: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton in tight race","Story highlights Trump has 45%, Clinton 42% and Gary Johnson 8%

Mitt Romney won the state by 8 points in 2012

Washington (CNN) Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a tight race in in Georgia, a traditionally deep red state, according to a new poll.

The Republican candidate has 45% to Clinton's 42% in the Monmouth University poll, within the poll's margin of error. Libertarian Gary Johnson had the support of 8% of likely voters.

Trump is underperforming previous GOP candidates. Mitt Romney won the state by 8 points in 2012 over President Barack Obama.

The incumbent Republican senator is also out-polling Trump. Sen. Johnny Isakson has a 16-point lead over challenger Jim Barksdale, 50% to 34%.

Clinton's strength comes from the Atlanta area, where she leads Trump 55% to 35%. But Trump leads her 51% to 33% elsewhere in the Peach State. She leads 88% to 4% among the state's black voters, but trails 20% to 66% among white voters.

Real_90-Webpage,Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there’s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.

Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we’d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.

Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn’t exactly go over well.

One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.

Chelsea began by asking Priebus:

“Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile?”

Adding:

“This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile.”

Chelsea then said:

“Stop telling women to smile. We don’t like that. It’s not an icebreaker, it’s a deal breaker.”

Going for Priebus’ jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says:

“You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November.”

And that’s exactly right.
