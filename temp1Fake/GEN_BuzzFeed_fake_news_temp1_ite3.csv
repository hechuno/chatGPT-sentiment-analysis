Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

In a recent statement, former President Bill Clinton addressed concerns regarding the practices of the Clinton Foundation, particularly in relation to donors seeking political favors. Clinton firmly stated that it is ""natural"" for political allies to make requests, underscoring the dynamics of political relationships. His comments come amid ongoing discussions about the intertwining of charitable work and political activity, a topic that has surged in prominence during this election cycle.

Clinton highlighted the integrity of the State Department, expressing confidence that requests for favors do not necessarily translate into actual favors being granted. This assertion aims to quell concerns that have emerged from the scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation and its associated activities. Leaked emails had recently revealed that some donors to the Clinton Foundation were granted meetings with the former president. However, Clinton was clear in pointing out that while these meetings occurred, there is a lack of evidence supporting claims of ""pay to play"" practices within the organization. This aspect is crucial as it suggests that, despite the perception of impropriety, the foundation's operations may not involve unethical exchanges.

In stark contrast, the Trump Foundation has found itself under fire for alleged misuse of charitable funds. Reports have emerged indicating that funds intended for charity may have been diverted for personal use by Donald Trump, raising serious questions about the foundation's ethical standing. These allegations have caught the attention of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is currently investigating the Trump Foundation for potential violations of charity laws. This ongoing investigation adds another layer of complexity to the already contentious landscape of charitable organizations and political engagement.

The discourse around both foundations has drawn significant media attention, and Media Matters has pointed out what it perceives as a double standard in how the media covers these issues. They argue that Clinton’s health matters receive disproportionate scrutiny compared to the investigations surrounding Trump’s charitable practices. This observation has sparked debates regarding media bias and its implications for political campaigns.

Critics of the current media landscape argue that biased coverage is detrimental to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, while inadvertently providing an advantage to Donald Trump. The contrasting narratives surrounding both candidates highlight deeper issues regarding media portrayal, the interplay of charity and politics, and the impact on electoral processes. As the election approaches, such discussions become increasingly significant, as they inform public perception and voter behavior.

These revelations and allegations surrounding both the Clinton and Trump foundations illustrate a broader concern regarding the intersection of money, politics, and power in American society. For many voters, these issues are not merely academic; they touch on fundamental questions of integrity and transparency in governance. The contrasting fortunes of both campaigns underscore the varying degrees of scrutiny each candidate faces, shaping the narrative as the election looms.

The implications of these findings are still unfolding, but they are undoubtedly significant factors as the Clinton campaign navigates the complexities of public perception in light of these controversies. Meanwhile, the investigations into the Trump Foundation could define a critical part of Trump’s narrative and public image during the election cycle.

Ultimately, both foundations serve as focal points in an ongoing discussion about ethics in political practices and the role of charitable organizations. Bill Clinton's reassurances about the integrity of the State Department and the operations of the Clinton Foundation, juxtaposed with the legal challenges posed to the Trump Foundation, are likely to fuel further debate as the campaigns progress.

As voters assess their options, the transparent handling of charitable funds, political relationships, and media portrayals will remain central themes in the run-up to the election. The outcomes of the investigations and the effectiveness of both candidates in addressing these controversies will ultimately shape the political landscape in the months ahead.",6.0,13.0,650.0,0.3,0.009230769230769232,710.0,0.48148148148148145,0.018309859154929577
Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

A draft congressional report has surfaced, alleging that the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a prominent program of the Clinton Foundation, distributed what is being termed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa, which may have significantly jeopardized the health of patients reliant on these treatments. The report, titled ""The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,"" was commissioned by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representing Tennessee, and is raising serious concerns as it outlines the ramifications of drug distribution tied to the initiative.

CHAI has long been regarded as a cornerstone of the Clinton Foundation's efforts to provide assistance to those affected by HIV/AIDS, particularly across regions heavily impacted by the disease. However, the findings of this report bring to light troubling connections between CHAI and Ranbaxy, a now-infamous Indian pharmaceutical company that has faced scrutiny over numerous quality control issues throughout its operations. The allegations against CHAI potentially compromise its standing and raise questions about the integrity of its initiatives.

Central to the allegations is the role played by Dinesh Thakur, a whistleblower who formerly worked at Ranbaxy. Thakur has been instrumental in shedding light on the drug manufacturing practices at the company, uncovering illicit activities that eventually prompted a major lawsuit. The situation escalated in 2013 when Ranbaxy pled guilty to several criminal charges associated with drug adulteration, culminating in a hefty $500 million fine imposed by the Department of Justice. These background events underscore the precarious nature of the drugs supplied by Ranbaxy, calling into question their safety and effectiveness for patients relying on them for their health.

The crux of Blackburn's report centers on the risks associated with HIV/AIDS patients receiving diluted medications. Preliminary findings suggest there has been an alarming increase in morbidity and mortality rates linked to the use of these compromised drugs. Blackburn does not shy away from illustrating the emotional toll inflicted upon patients and healthcare workers, emphasizing that the effects are both immediate and far-reaching. This facet raises ethical concerns regarding the commitment of the Clinton Foundation to uphold the wellbeing of those it aims to assist.

In addition to spotlighting the drug quality issues, Blackburn's inquiries draw attention to the significant funding from the U.S. government that has been directed towards Ranbaxy. The exact number of patients who may have received these compromised medications during CHAI's distribution remains unclear, but experts warn that the implications of substandard HIV treatments can lead to dire health consequences for those affected. Thakur himself has consistently highlighted the alarming outcomes that can stem from the use of inadequate HIV medications, reinforcing the urgency of addressing these issues.

Quality control failures at Ranbaxy were evident as early as 2004, with increasing scrutiny from the FDA beginning in 2006. Despite these red flags, CHAI continued to endorse Ranbaxy's distributions of HIV/AIDS drugs across international markets. This ongoing relationship raises significant questions about accountability and the ethics of prioritizing partnerships with potentially problematic entities in pursuit of enhancing global health initiatives.

The report by Blackburn also poses complications for the Clinton Foundation, particularly as the timing aligns with Hillary Clinton's campaign for the presidency. As the investigation probes deeper into the connections between the Clintons and various Indian-American businessmen with questionable reputations, it poses a risk for additional scrutiny surrounding the foundation's operations. The investigation further investigates whether there has been a relaxation of drug quality standards that could be linked to an executive order signed by Bill Clinton in 2000, which could have facilitated the issues regarding Ranbaxy’s practices.

Fundamentally, the findings raise not only concerns about the safety of medical treatments but also potential corruption and financial gain arising from collaborations between the Clinton Foundation and pharmaceutical manufacturers like Ranbaxy. Blackburn has raised alarm over the perceived misleading promises made to patients and healthcare workers by the initiative, calling into question the integrity of both the foundation and the CHAI's operational frameworks.

In presenting the report, Rep. Blackburn submitted her findings to the inspectors general at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of State, marking a significant step towards greater transparency and accountability regarding the Clinton Foundation's influence on healthcare practices internationally.

As the situation unfolds, the report is likely to provoke discussions on the role of political foundations in global health initiatives and whether adequate safeguards exist to protect vulnerable populations. With the potential ramifications of the findings anticipated to extend beyond the political sphere, the topic is sure to remain at the forefront of public discourse, particularly in light of the sensitive health implications associated with inadequate HIV/AIDS treatments. 

The overarching implications of Blackburn's report signal a pivotal moment not only for public health but also for the ethical standards that should govern international humanitarian efforts and healthcare delivery systems. As stakeholders await further investigation and accountability measures, the complexity and gravity of the claims made invite a critical examination of existing frameworks and their capacity to uphold the integrity of health interventions worldwide. 

While the Clinton Foundation has yet to issue a response to the report, the revelations concerning CHAI and its associations with Ranbaxy underline the need for unwavering vigilance in the distribution of medical care and pharmaceutical products, particularly in regions that are already burdened by the severe impacts of disease. The fate of many patient lives could hinge on the outcomes of these inquiries and the actions taken in their wake, underscoring the essential nature of accountability and ethical governance in the realm of healthcare. 

In summary, Rep. Marsha Blackburn's draft report illuminates significant and potentially harmful practices associated with the Clinton Health Access Initiative’s handling of HIV/AIDS drug distribution. As the investigation progresses, it promises to fuel critical discussions about the ethics of humanitarian efforts and the impact of political affiliations on global health initiatives.",-6.0,0.0,1573.0,-0.11320754716981132,-0.003814367450731087,1068.0,0.0,0.0
Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a shocking incident at a September 11 memorial ceremony in New York City, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton collapsed just before entering her transportation. The alarming scene unfolded as onlookers watched her being hastily removed from the event due to health concerns. This incident has led to widespread speculation regarding Clinton's health, especially as she prepares for her potential candidacy in the upcoming presidential election.

Shortly after the incident, Clinton made a striking appearance at her daughter Chelsea's apartment. Those who witnessed her later noted a dramatic transformation in her appearance. Observers remarked that she looked significantly different, showcasing considerable weight loss, vibrant energy, and changes in her facial structure. Speculation regarding her well-being intensified as critics began to take a closer look at the nuances of her transformed appearance.

Some speculators have gone as far as to suggest that Clinton may not actually be the person she was previously known as. Observers pointed out a noticeable alteration in her nose shape, postulating that the individual seen later might be a clone. According to these speculations, the alleged double possesses a Roman nose, whereas the real Hillary Clinton features a more Nordic nose. The discussion around her appearance fueled further intrigue, opening up a larger conversation about authenticity in leadership.

In addition to the nose shape, the supposed doppelgänger appears to embody a more youthful visage, exhibiting fewer signs of aging. This observation raised additional questions, particularly regarding a prominent mole that has historically been present above the real Hillary's right lip—a distinguishing mark that was reportedly absent from the face of her recent public appearance.

The discourse surrounding Clinton's health, coupled with these appearance discrepancies, has led observers to contemplate serious implications for her potential campaign strategy. Many express concern regarding her ability to perform effectively in the high-stakes environment of debating and campaigning against prominent opponents, including former President Donald Trump. As critical public engagements loom, there are rising doubts about whether the public will see the real Hillary Clinton during such pivotal moments.

Critical voices have raised concerns about her potential absence from key political events, including debates, public appearances, and potentially even the inauguration if she were to secure a win in the election. This leads to an unsettling question regarding the capability for leadership and decision-making within a new administration should she proceed with her campaign. Doubts linger over whether the decisions would genuinely reflect Hillary Clinton's views or if they would instead be orchestrated by a cabinet guided by her plausible double.

Some critics highlight this situation in stark comparison to former President Obama, implying that the unexpected challenges surrounding Clinton's health may lead to greater suspicions about the authenticity of leadership in the political arena. The questions posed are concerning; it urges the electorate to consider the ramifications of leadership that may operate behind a veil of uncertainty, possibly undermining public trust.

In light of these developments, there looms a deep concern among observers that Hillary Clinton may ultimately become a figurehead rather than an active decision-maker in her administration. This speculation touches on the core essence of democratic representation and is certain to instigate heated debates about accountability and authenticity in leadership roles.

As this complex scenario continues to unfold, one thing remains clear: the focus is shifting toward the implications of health and vitality on the candidacy and potential leadership of Hillary Clinton. These speculations, while rooted in visible transformations, reflect deeper anxieties regarding the nature of political integrity and the underlying dynamics of authenticity that the public seeks in its leaders.

These views highlight significant concerns regarding Clinton's current standing in the political landscape, reflecting a larger narrative about the importance of unambiguous leadership in times of uncertainty. While some may reject such assertions as mere conjecture, the discussions underscore a growing unease surrounding the capabilities of political figures in navigating the intricate web of modern-day governance.

Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

As the 2016 presidential campaign hits a fever pitch, Donald Trump's controversial comments regarding immigration policies have sparked significant debate and concern across the nation. His inflammatory remarks have been widely criticized for inflaming tensions surrounding immigrants and Muslims, raising questions about civil rights and the implications of his proposed policies.

Trump's rhetoric often centers around a stark portrayal of immigrants from certain countries. In a chilling remark that has drawn widespread condemnation, he suggested the need to build a wall to keep out immigrants whom he labeled as “rapists” and “drug dealers.” This characterization has not only alienated large communities of legal immigrants but also propagated a fear-mongering narrative that many argue undermines the values of inclusivity and compassion that America is known for.

His proposals extend beyond mere rhetoric. Trump made headlines with his suggestion for a national registry specifically for Muslims, alongside a controversial idea that they should wear special identification badges. Critics have been quick to draw parallels to Nazi Germany, suggesting that such policies echo some of the darkest chapters in history and pose a threat to the civil liberties of millions of Americans. In an increasingly diverse society, such moves are seen as regressive and harmful.

Furthermore, Trump has made alarming statements regarding his approach to combating terrorism. In a chilling declaration, he indicated that he would support actions to kill the families of terrorists, stating simply, “you have to take out their families.” This perspective represents a drastic shift in approaches to national security and the fight against terrorism, leaning heavily toward a brutal “kill them all” ideology. This stands in stark contrast to the more balanced strategies espoused by former President Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who advocate for a more nuanced approach to engaging with international threats.

Blaming the previous administration, Trump claims that failed policies under Obama and Clinton have led to a significant increase in the number of immigrants from dangerous countries, pointing to a 550% rise in Syrian refugees specifically. This assertion feeds into the narrative that the current immigration system is flawed and poses a direct threat to American safety—a stance that has resonated with many of his supporters. However, critics argue that focusing on refugees as a primary threat distracts from the realities of complex geopolitical issues and the genuine humanitarian crisis faced by those fleeing violence.

Trump has not shied away from placing blame on the Muslim community as a whole for the actions of radicals. He has made statements implying that Muslims should report suspicious activities to authorities, suggesting a collective responsibility that paints the entire community with a broad brush. This rhetoric raises significant concerns about stigmatization and further marginalization of Muslims in America, fostering an atmosphere of fear and distrust.

The implications of these statements are troubling, with fears mounting over what a Trump presidency could herald for American Muslims. Concerns are rife over the potential for a mass rounding up of Muslims or violent actions against them as a consequence of the dangerous precedent being set by such remarks. In a nation founded on principles of liberty and justice, the prospect of targeting a specific religious or ethnic group is alarming and oversteps the bounds of civil rights.

Recent attacks, including those in New York and New Jersey carried out by an American citizen, serve as a reminder that threats to national security do not solely stem from immigration issues or from outside actors. These incidents point to critical discussions about civil rights and how fear-driven rhetoric could lead to a more aggressive stance on domestic policies that disproportionately affect marginalized communities.

As Trump continues to rally supporters with a message that resonates with those seeking change, it is essential to critically assess the implications of his statements and proposed policies. The rhetoric surrounding immigration and counterterrorism must not come at the expense of civil liberties and the values that define America. 

As the election approaches, voters are urged to consider the implications of supporting a candidate whose proposals and statements may incite division and fear. The potential consequences of Trump's presidency could alter the landscape of civil rights and national security for generations to come. Engagement in the democratic process becomes imperative, as the stakes have never been higher. 

In light of these developments, communities across the nation are being called upon to exercise their civic duty by participating in the electoral process, evaluating candidates with a keen eye on their policies and the potential ramifications.

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}","- President Obama spoke at the United Nations, promoting the concept of a One World Government.

Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Recent allegations of pay-to-play corruption have surfaced, implicating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. The accusations have sparked intense scrutiny regarding the foundation's operations and its financial priorities.

Initially, the Clinton campaign sought to redirect attention from the allegations by underscoring the charitable work of the foundation. Advocates for the foundation claim it has done significant work in various humanitarian sectors. However, critics argue that the organization primarily functions as a profit-generating entity for the Clinton family and their associates, raising questions about its true purpose as a charitable institution.

In an article published by The Daily Caller, concerns regarding the financial transparency and allocation of funds within the Clinton Foundation have been highlighted. A striking statistic indicated that only 5.7% of the foundation’s 2014 budget was designated for charitable grants. Instead, the foundation allocated nearly $91.3 million that year, with less than $5.2 million directed specifically to charitable causes.

Further analysis of the 2014 financial reports reveals that the foundation spent a substantial $34.8 million on salaries, compensation, and employee benefits. Additionally, an alarming $50.4 million was categorized under “other expenses,” raising eyebrows about the nature of these expenditures. Notably, despite an increase of $30 million in revenue from the prior year, the foundation's spending on charitable grants actually plummeted by 40% compared to 2013.

Moreover, the significant rise in salaries, employee benefits, and other miscellaneous expenses—a total increase of $5 million—contrasts sharply with the diminished financial support for charitable causes. This discrepancy has led critics to assert that the operational practices of the Clinton Foundation warrant deeper investigation, as they suspect a misalignment of the organization’s stated mission versus its financial behavior.

These revelations culminate in a troubling portrait of potential ethical lapses and the implications of financial practices that could allow for political favors. The growing scrutiny surrounding the Clinton Foundation's operations indicates that these concerns are far from being merely speculative.

In conclusion, the financial and operational practices of the Clinton Foundation raise genuine ethical questions regarding its legitimacy as a charitable organization and the potential motivations driving its actions. The opinions expressed in this article solely represent the author’s views and do not necessarily reflect the perspectives of EagleRising.com. The ongoing discourse surrounding these allegations underscores the need for transparency and accountability in philanthropic endeavors.",25.0,14.0,419.0,1.6666666666666667,0.059665871121718374,449.0,0.7777777777777778,0.031180400890868598
Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

During that event, she convulsed and had to be assisted into her van, prompting widespread concern. Initially, her campaign attributed the episode to the heat, but weather data indicated that temperatures in New York City were a mild 74 degrees.

In the aftermath of the incident, Clinton was taken to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment for recovery, passing several hospitals along the way. Questions have since emerged regarding the authenticity of her recovery, with some alleging that the rally was staged to project a façade of normalcy. 

Compounding these suspicions, a video from the rally has garnered attention for its unusual camera positioning, leading some to speculate on the authenticity of the audience. Critics have also released an additional video suggesting that the audience may have been faked. 

In response to the scrutiny, C-Span has provided footage in an attempt to verify that nothing was manipulated in the recordings of the rally. The situation continues to develop, as observers remain divided on the implications of these recent events surrounding Clinton’s health and public appearance.",4.0,-1.0,251.0,0.5714285714285714,0.01593625498007968,230.0,-0.1111111111111111,-0.004347826086956522
Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

As the 2024 election season approaches, anticipation builds not just for the candidates themselves but for how they will be portrayed in the media. One such satirical portrayal that has garnered attention is ""Weekend at Chelsea’s,"" a play on the beloved cult classic film ""Weekend at Bernie’s."" This title, however humorous, underscores a serious discourse surrounding the health of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Critics of this portrayal suggest it is emblematic of deeper media biases that favor Clinton while potentially downplaying genuine health concerns.

In the current political climate, media bias has become a hotly contested topic, with many arguing that major outlets would prefer to frame Clinton's health issues as trivial rather than address them directly. This perceived favoritism toward Clinton has raised eyebrows, especially among voters who remain skeptical of her fitness for office. As she positions herself for a potential campaign, detractors assert that her health should not be overlooked simply because of the lens through which the media tends to portray her.

Claims surrounding Clinton's health have intensified, with some sources insisting that she is severely ill. This contention directly challenges previous dismissals of her health issues. For many observers, the narrative that Clinton has had minor health setbacks does not align with her past medical history, which includes a significant brain blood clot that raised alarm bells when it occurred. The fear remains that her current health episodes may indicate something more severe, casting a long shadow over her viability as a candidate.

Further complicating the narrative is the belief that Clinton's campaign is not being forthright about her health. Critics argue that when it comes to disclosing her fitness for presidency, elements of dishonesty loom large. Given that public trust is paramount for any political figure, particularly one as polarizing as Clinton, this opacity breeds apprehension among the electorate. How can voters place their faith in a leader whose health remains a source of controversy?

Compounding these issues are Clinton's declining approval ratings. With the electorate increasingly wary of her, the growing negative perception of Clinton is difficult to ignore. Once a formidable force in American politics, her influence seems dampened as polls indicate a troubling trend for her potential candidacy. This rift in public confidence ties closely to her controversial remarks in the past, particularly her infamous labeling of Trump supporters as “deplorables.” Those comments not only alienated a significant faction of voters but also expose a perceived hypocrisy in her political discourse.

While the author of this analysis expresses mixed feelings about Clinton's health, it is crucial to momentarily step outside the realm of political rivalry. It is indeed a human experience to face health challenges, and expressing compassion for someone's struggles is inherently valuable. However, this sentiment doesn’t excuse any behavior that could be viewed as out of touch or hypocritical. By juxtaposing compassion with candid criticism of Clinton's actions and their ramifications, we find ourselves navigating a complicated landscape.

In light of her health challenges, one must also consider the potential for Clinton to remain politically active, should she choose to do so. Despite her ongoing health issues, politicians have an uncanny ability to remain within the political sphere. Many in her position have reinvigorated their careers after facing adversity and challenge. Speculation suggests that she may steer a course that keeps her in the political limelight, integrating a sense of resilience into her narrative. Nevertheless, the public will undoubtedly scrutinize her movements closely, pondering her capability while constantly referencing her health concerns.

Moreover, as the political landscape continues to change, a collective prayer for her future well-being accompanies any discussion of her political choices. Illness, especially at a high-stakes level such as presidential politics, often yields far-reaching implications. The intersection of Clinton's health and her political future creates a landscape rife with emotion—a duality of concern for a public figure and the critical examination of her past actions.

It is important to note that the viewpoints expressed herein are personal reflections and not necessarily representative of the publication's stance. This distinction serves as a reminder that within the polarized atmosphere of contemporary politics, every individual perspective adds another layer to the understanding of the complex narratives at play.

In conclusion, as ""Weekend at Chelsea’s"" captures not just the humor but also the gravity of Clinton's current situation, one must reflect on what it means for her future in American politics. Behind every headline and every quip lies a multifaceted individual grappling with significant health challenges against the backdrop of public service. Whether viewed through a lens of skepticism or compassion, Hillary Clinton’s path forward will undoubtedly be scrutinized as the world watches. The intersection of her health, media portrayal, and public perception paints a broader picture of a woman who has stood resilient through decades of political tumult. As the dialogue continues, one can only hope for her health and well-being, regardless of political allegiance. 

In essence, the political landscape is as unpredictable as Clinton's health, and only time will reveal how these threads will intertwine as the election draws near. Political satire has its place, but earnest discussions about health, character, and honesty must also have a voice in the narratives shaping our political future.",-18.0,0.0,1165.0,-0.375,-0.015450643776824034,1008.0,0.0,0.0

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

In a poignant final address delivered to the United Nations General Assembly, former President Barack Obama addressed the pressing challenges the United States faces in its efforts to defeat ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups. His message highlighted the complexities of the conflict and underscored the inadequacy of military solutions to navigate the multifaceted nature of the issues at hand.

During his address, Obama expressed significant skepticism concerning the effectiveness of military interventions, reiterating the notion that no external power holds the capability to force coexistence among the diverse religious and ethnic communities embroiled in conflict. This assertion prompted reflection on the historical impacts of military engagement in regions marked by deep-seated tensions, suggesting a necessity to reconsider strategies in favor of more sustainable solutions.

Advocating for a diplomatic approach, Obama emphasized the importance of engaging in dialogue to alleviate violence, deliver humanitarian aid, and bolster political settlements. He articulated a clear understanding that the situation in Syria, in particular, represents an arena where achieving a military victory remains an unlikely outcome. This candid acknowledgment challenges the prevailing narratives concerning military triumphs, urging for a shift towards dialogues and negotiations.

However, the address has been met with criticism, particularly from those who argue that a liberal perspective tends to diminish the links between radical Islam and violent extremism. Observers contend that such views undermine the urgency of tackling the root issues driving radicalization. Critics assert that a more direct approach is essential to effectively confront and dismantle the threat posed by radical Islam—notwithstanding Obama's more cautious and often perceived as defeatist tone.

The calls for action extend beyond mere recognition of the issues; advocates argue that urgent measures must be taken before the extremist ideologies further entrench themselves within affected communities. There is a growing belief that without decisive action, the cycle of violence will continue unabated, demanding immediate attention and a reevaluation of how the world addresses the complex landscape of modern extremism.

In this context, it is crucial for individuals to engage with these pressing matters, reflecting on the implications of both military and non-military strategies. The need for rethinking tactics against radical Islam has never been more pronounced, and the conversation surrounding these choices is vital as society grapples with the realities of contemporary conflicts.

As such, the writer encourages readers to express their viewpoints on social media, fostering awareness and dialogue on these critical issues. In navigating the intricate relationship between radical ideologies and their violent manifestations, public discourse plays a pivotal role in shaping future policies and strategies aimed at achieving a more peaceful coexistence worldwide. Without proactive discussions and collective efforts, the risk posed by radical extremism may only deepen, necessitating a more thoughtful approach to international diplomacy and intervention in the years to come.",-5.0,-1.0,503.0,-0.23809523809523808,-0.009940357852882704,522.0,-0.058823529411764705,-0.0019157088122605363
Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Declassified Defense Intelligence documents have brought to light significant insights suggesting that the rise of ISIS and the establishment of a caliphate were anticipated by the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) as early as 2012. These revelations have sparked renewed scrutiny over the U.S. government's role in the conflict in Syria during the Obama Administration.

The documents indicate that there were claims the Obama Administration may have deliberately fostered the growth of ISIS as a strategy to isolate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government. Investigative journalist Nafeez Ahmed highlighted that the West's intentional sponsorship of violent Islamist groups aimed at destabilizing Assad was conducted despite an awareness of the potential emergence of an Islamic State.

Further insights from the declassified materials underscore predictions that support from Western nations, as well as Turkey and Gulf states, for various militant groups, would lead to the formation of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria. This long-term forecast raises questions about the decision-making processes of U.S. officials and their alignment with the actual outcomes in the region.

Criticism has also been directed at President Obama, particularly regarding his characterization of ISIS as a “JV” team, a term often viewed as an underestimation of the group's capabilities. Middle Eastern experts have pointed to the decision not to maintain a residual military presence in Iraq as a tactical error that may have contributed to the destabilization of the region.

Moreover, the newly released documents shed light on U.S. weapons operations in Libya before the tragic 2012 Benghazi attack. Evidence has emerged indicating that U.S. intelligence was aware of arms being sent from Benghazi to Syrian ports, raising significant concerns about the operational decisions made during that period.

The findings have led to serious accusations that American servicemen and personnel in Benghazi were sacrificed due to covert Middle Eastern policies, which prioritized the concealment of crucial facts over national security. As more details continue to emerge, the implications of these revelations are likely to fuel ongoing debates concerning U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and the rise of extremist groups like ISIS.",-27.0,-5.0,381.0,-3.0,-0.07086614173228346,390.0,-0.4166666666666667,-0.01282051282051282
Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

In a remarkable series of events following the 9-11 remembrance ceremony in New York City, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was observed collapsing before entering her vehicle. This concerning incident has sparked widespread speculation about her current health and fitness for public life, especially as the political landscape gears up ahead of the upcoming election.

Shortly after the alarming scene, Clinton re-emerged at her daughter Chelsea Clinton's apartment. However, she appeared significantly different from her earlier public appearance. Observers noted a marked increase in her energy levels, as well as a notable change in her physical appearance that has drawn considerable public discussion. Most strikingly, Clinton appeared to have an altered nose, suggesting a departure from her previous look. The speculation is rife, with some commentators drawing comparisons to a Roman nose, contrasting sharply with what has been described as her earlier Nordic features.

Conspiracy theories have begun to circulate regarding these observations, with some suggesting that the individual spotted at Chelsea's apartment is, in fact, a ""clone"" of the real Hillary Clinton. This alleged clone presents a more youthful visage, free from the visible signs of aging that one would typically expect, raising eyebrows and prompting questions about the identity of the person poised to represent Clinton in public.

Sources close to the situation have pointed out that while the real Hillary Clinton may be grappling with health issues, the persona who appeared after the ceremony exhibits signs of increased vitality. This divergence from her previous public demeanor has prompted serious speculation about her capacity to engage in upcoming political debates, particularly against former President Donald Trump.

The characteristics that observers have noted as identifiers of this purported clone include an absence of the health symptoms that have occasionally plagued the former Secretary of State—such as cough or hoarseness. This has led to further inquiries into whether the real Clinton will remain involved in her political career, especially if her clone assumes a significant role in public appearances.

What complicates matters further is the question of Clinton's potential involvement in governance should she secure an electoral victory. There are growing concerns among political analysts and voters alike regarding whether the real Hillary Clinton will be at the helm of her administration, or if the clone will take on the public-facing roles typically associated with a presidential office. This situation raises critical implications for how a Clinton administration might operate independently of her actual leadership.

The narrative emerging from this circumstance posits a historical shift in U.S. political proceedings. If Hillary Clinton were to continue in a diminished role, with her clone representing her during essential duties, it may very well mark a turning point in the expectation of governance in modern-day America. Imagine the ramifications for the political process if a candidate’s synthesis—particularly one as high-profile as Clinton—could potentially function apart from the person voters believed they elected.

The repercussions of all these theories extend into a broader societal discourse around health, identity, and political representation. Whether or not one subscribes to the notion of cloning, the fundamental question persists: What does it mean for a democratic society if a leader is not physically participating in governance?

As this enigmatic situation continues to unfold, it is certain that opinions will diverge, debates will rage, and speculation will heighten regarding the true state of Hillary Clinton's health and her capability to engage in the rigors of political life. The broader implications for the upcoming election, campaign strategies, and civic engagement cannot be overstated as voters strive to understand the leadership they might be casting their ballots for.

In conclusion, the unfolding narrative surrounding Hillary Clinton raises urgent questions about identity, representation, and the fundamental nature of political leadership in the United States. As we move forward, the American electorate remains vigilant, keenly aware of the changes and challenges that lie ahead in this evolving political landscape.",8.0,18.0,656.0,0.36363636363636365,0.012195121951219513,734.0,0.72,0.02452316076294278
Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Recent rumors regarding Hillary Clinton's health have sparked concern among supporters and political analysts alike, particularly following the release of a video that appears to show the former Secretary of State losing control of her eyes. This unsettling footage, which surfaced yesterday, has led to heightened scrutiny of Clinton's well-being as she navigates a challenging phase in her political career.

In the wake of the video, Clinton canceled a fundraising event in North Carolina that was scheduled for the same day, prompting questions about her current state. Research indicates that Clinton has only one rally planned between September 20 and October 19, with the majority of her upcoming events being fundraisers where she is not slated to speak. This limited schedule contrasts sharply with her political rival, Donald Trump, who has four rallies lined up between September 20 and 22, raising further concerns about Clinton's campaign viability.

Adding to the health speculation, reports have emerged claiming Clinton required Secret Service assistance to manage basic movements, such as navigating a couple of steps at a recent rally. Observers suggest that these incidents may signal underlying health issues that could become more evident in the coming days, prompting fears of a potential public meltdown.

Rumors are also circulating within the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which is reportedly exploring potential replacements for Clinton as the party grapples with her perceived decline. There is evident anxiety among party insiders, particularly given that prominent figures such as Bernie Sanders have shown little interest in entering the presidential race.

Historically, Clinton has been positioned by the DNC as the best and only candidate for the upcoming election, receiving significant backing and support within the party. However, the ongoing discussions about her health may undermine this narrative, with some asserting that these issues will soon be more widely recognized by the public, challenging assumptions about her fitness for duty.

As these revelations unfold, both Clinton's supporters and skeptics are bracing for what may come next. Analysts predict that the next few days will bring new insights into Clinton's health and the broader implications for the integrity of the Democratic party as it navigates this uncertain landscape. The fallout from these developments could have lasting effects on Clinton's campaign and the DNC's strategic positioning as the election cycle progresses.",-8.0,7.0,416.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.019230769230769232,438.0,0.5,0.01598173515981735
Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.

In a bizarre twist of fate, former President Barack Obama found himself wandering the halls of the White House one restless night, grappling with insomnia. It was during this solitary excursion, marked by a swirl of thoughts and an undeniable sense of restlessness, that he stumbled upon an idea that would come to play a pivotal role in global headlines—ISIS.

The recollection of this moment has been shared more informally than formally, capturing the imagination of the public and sparking critiques about the origins of the task force against international terrorism. Obama noted how the word ""ISIS"" suddenly dawned on him, scribbling it down in a moment of creativity fueled by fatigue. An innocuous note that would later resonate with grave power and consequence.

Fast forward several months to an unexpected venue—Coachella, an annual festival celebrated for its vibrant music and arts scene. Unsure if it was the pulsating beats or the kaleidoscope of colors, Obama experienced a strange wave of inspiration. Reflecting on his earlier nocturnal musings, the idea of forming an international terrorist group took shape. This newfound ambition struck him with the same fervor as lyrics from a catchy song, compelling and intense.

In a surprisingly candid moment, he confided his strange ambitions to none other than Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, during an informal gathering in the White House kitchen. As they enjoyed popsicles—an unexpected element in their serious dialogue—the two political titans engaged in a spirited discussion about their plans. The juxtaposition of politics and simple childhood treats provided a surreal backdrop for what would ultimately become a daring, if unprecedented plot.

With a twinkle in his eye, Obama humorously proclaimed a fictional identity: he claimed to be a 97-year-old man hailing from Kenya, destined to sow chaos in America. This humorous yet bizarre proclamation drew laughter from Hillary as they shared this light-hearted moment, juxtaposed against the weighty discussions about global terrorism. 

Amidst the levity, a more serious tone emerged. Obama revealed one of his more whimsical ideas: he believed that his dog, Bo, was in fact a supercomputer, adept in the art of communication through Morse code. The absurdity of this notion, spun from an imaginative mind grappling with both insomnia and the pressures of leadership, added another layer of complexity to their conversation.

Hillary's response was a mix of disbelief and amusement. She found herself in the midst of what could be described as an almost fantastical narrative spun by her partner in political discourse. The laughter shared over their unexpected quirks brought an unusual warmth to the discussion, which might ordinarily be marked by caution. Such interactions opened a window into a relationship that thrived on a balance of pragmatism and whimsy.

Meanwhile, the pair turned their attention to the more serious aspects of their clandestine discussions. Relaxing amid the serene ambiance of the Rose Garden, the duo plotted the strategies for their formidable venture, the very essence of their conversations echoing a fictional take on frightening modern realities. The audacity of their talk further solidified their bond as colleagues and friends. 

“You know,” Hillary mused, “it might be wise to hold off on our plans until I achieve the presidency. It would allow us to act more strategically and discreetly.” Her suggestion, laced with pragmatic wisdom, humorously hinted at the broader political game they were engaging in. The notion of ""secretly destroying America"" struck a chord, though it was wrapped in irony and undeniable absurdity.

As they continued their open-hearted sessions, the feelings of camaraderie and mutual respect blossomed between the two. Each unlikely conversation brought them closer, weaving a deeper understanding of each other’s eccentricities and ideologies. Obama left their gatherings with a renewed sense of excitement—his mind whirling with implications of their discussions. 

The absurd notion of plotting to create a terrorist organization while relaxing over popsicles seemed to defy logic, yet it painted a unique portrait of the human side of political figures often viewed through a stringent lens. In the end, while their light-hearted ambitions spun out into realms of disbelief, what remained was a testament to the complexities of friendship, leadership, and the extraordinary happenings within the walls of power.

In reflecting upon this whimsical enterprise, one cannot help but consider the serious implications of such narratives. They remind us that even in high-stakes environments, there exist moments of levity, incredulity, and creativity. Such insights may challenge our perceptions, not only of political figures but of the nature of conversations we often assume are strictly conventional.

As Obama and Hillary’s clandestine discussions linger in the public consciousness, they serve as a peculiar reminder that inspiration can emerge from the most unexpected places—be it a sleepless night or a vibrant music festival. How they translated those moments into scheme—regardless of how outlandish it may appear—beckons a deeper dialogue around the nature of political ambition, imagination, and the absurdity woven into the fabric of leadership.

In this extraordinary journey marked by humor and audacity, Obama and Hillary shared more than just a collection of whimsical ideas; they forged a bond that underscored the human elements often overshadowed by politics. Through their quirky, unconventional notions, they not only entertained but also enlightened about the unpredictable nature of human relationships, even at the highest levels of governance. 

Thus, the story of isolated revelations leading to an international conversation about terrorism serves as a reminder of how easily narratives can intertwine, illustrating the subtleties of friendship, strategy, and the intersections of imagination within the corridors of power.",-4.0,25.0,1723.0,-0.045454545454545456,-0.0023215322112594312,1056.0,0.625,0.023674242424242424
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

In the wake of recent terrorist attacks in Chelsea and Minnesota, former President Donald Trump has reignited his vow to ""destroy"" terrorism in America. However, political commentator Frank Wilkenmeyer has offered a critical perspective on the implications of such sweeping promises, drawing parallels to historical statements made by previous leaders. 

The phrase ""read my lips…no new taxes,"" famously uttered by George H.W. Bush during his 1988 campaign, serves as a cautionary tale that underscores the dangers of bold political promises that lack substantive plans. Bush's administration faced backlash after he reversed course on tax increases, ultimately damaging his credibility and leading to his defeat in the 1992 election. Similarly, Wilkenmeyer suggests that Trump's grand declarations might not only be devoid of practical strategies but also risk painting a misguided vision of how to address complex societal issues like terrorism.

Crucially, Trump’s latest declaration has been criticized for its lack of specificity. The former president has not provided clear plans regarding increased funding for counter-terrorism initiatives, nor has he detailed comprehensive strategies aimed at effectively combating terrorism. This absence of a concrete policy framework raises concerns about the sincerity and feasibility of his commitment. Without actionable steps and adequate resources, sweeping statements can feel hollow, leaving citizens with little assurance that real change is on the horizon.

Moreover, the rhetoric used to discuss terrorism under a Trump-led regime raises alarm bells regarding potential profiling of American Muslims. Wilkenmeyer warns that vague promises to combat terrorism could lead to the erosion of due process rights, implicating entire communities based on the actions of a few individuals. There is a palpable fear that increased policing in neighborhoods with significant Muslim populations could result in discrimination and create a hostile environment for residents, breaching fundamental American principles of equality and justice.

The implications of such rhetoric extend far beyond the surface. Wilkenmeyer cautions against the use of extreme language when discussing terrorism, suggesting that it could signal a worrying slide towards authoritarianism. Alarmist statements can foster an atmosphere of fear and division, which not only stigmatizes specific communities but also undermines the social fabric of the nation as a whole. The tendency to respond to threats with hyperbolic rhetoric is one that history has shown can pave the way for policies that prioritize control over civil liberties.

Furthermore, Wilkenmeyer's skepticism about Trump’s capability to follow through on his promises reflects a broader concern regarding the viability of such an approach. Comparing Trump's rhetoric to past political blunders, he argues that this form of fearmongering is not new, but rather a repeated cycle that often backfires. Promising an unequivocal ""destruction"" of a complex issue like terrorism overlooks the multifaceted nature of such problems, casting aside necessary dialogue and nuanced understanding.

As discussions unfold surrounding Trump's statements, it becomes increasingly clear that fearmongering is often directed towards vulnerable groups. By framing terrorism in existential terms, Trump’s rhetoric can serve to marginalize those already facing societal scrutiny. This dynamic not only creates divisions but also distracts from fostering a comprehensive national response predicated on inclusivity and resilience.

In conclusion, as Trump positions himself as a decisive figure in the fight against terrorism, the lack of specificity in his promises warrants scrutiny. Wilkenmeyer’s critique highlights the potential ramifications of such rhetoric, including civil rights violations and societal polarization. The dangers of extreme language, especially in matters as grave as national security, cannot be underestimated. A measured approach, grounded in empathy and understanding, may prove more effective in addressing the root causes of terrorism without sacrificing the freedoms that define American democracy. Looking ahead, the discourse surrounding this critical issue will be pivotal in shaping the future of national security and civil rights in the United States.",-28.0,-24.0,700.0,-1.12,-0.04,719.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.03337969401947149

Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

In a stark assessment delivered at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno issued a warning about a precarious tipping point for national security, citing escalating terrorism threats alongside hostilities from the Soviet Union and North Korea. Odierno emphasized that the Army currently only maintains sufficient readiness to address immediate needs, suggesting that further reductions could critically undermine military effectiveness.

The general's remarks come against the backdrop of ongoing military purging, which he attributes to a widening chasm between the Obama Administration and military leaders. This disconnect, according to Odierno, has contributed to significant strategic failures, particularly the resurgence of ISIS, which underscores the repercussions of ignoring military advice and strategies.

Highlighting the evolving security landscape, Odierno pointed out that America faces significant challenges and strategic inflection points, facing increasingly capable adversaries that threaten the nation's safety. The implications of such threats are exacerbated by recent military cuts, with the Army having reduced its ranks by 80,000 soldiers and reorganized its structure, resulting in the elimination of 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades.

Furthermore, investment in modernization programs has seen a worrying decline of 25%. This reduction is jeopardizing essential updates to key military assets, including infantry fighting vehicles and scout helicopters, thereby limiting the Army’s ability to remain competitive and effective in various operational arenas.

Odierno’s criticisms of the administration highlight a perceived disregard for military leaders, which he argues results in increased instability and strategic vulnerabilities. As the nature of global threats continues to evolve, Odierno's statements call into question the current trajectory of military readiness and strategic foresight, urging a reevaluation of defense priorities to better prepare for the challenges ahead.",-4.0,-15.0,364.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.01098901098901099,337.0,-1.5,-0.04451038575667656

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.

The proposal, which is slated to take effect on September 30, 2016, has sparked significant concern over its implications for freedom of speech, thought, and the exchange of ideas online.

Critics of the plan argue that it could empower authoritarian regimes, including countries like Russia, China, and Iran, to censor online content. This potential for censorship could extend beyond their borders, potentially impacting speech and expression even within the United States.

In light of these serious concerns, Cruz is calling on Congress to act swiftly to prevent the proposed transfer of control. He emphasizes that safeguarding the freedom of the Internet is crucial for protecting individual rights and ensuring that diverse perspectives can be shared without the threat of governmental interference. As the deadline approaches, the debate continues over the implications of this significant policy shift, with Cruz firmly positioned against the administration's initiative.",3.0,11.0,218.0,0.2727272727272727,0.013761467889908258,205.0,1.5714285714285714,0.05365853658536585

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

As the November elections approach, the discourse surrounding election integrity has intensified across the United States. Every state has established laws governing election procedures, yet allegations are surfacing that the National Democratic Party is involved in efforts to “steal elections” through a variety of illegal means. These claims raise questions about the fairness and transparency of the electoral process.

The author of this piece posits that the Democratic Party operates as a powerful hate group with ambitions to establish a socialist dictatorship in the U.S. A particularly bold claim within this narrative is the assertion that the party's strategy includes attempting to install Hillary Clinton as president by leveraging voter fraud and ballot stuffing during the 2016 election. According to the author, this manipulation is part of a broader agenda to undermine democratic values.

In an ideal election, citizens should feel encouraged to participate in the democratic process. However, the author expresses strong opposition to any methods they perceive as potential enablers of voting fraud. One of the key advocacy points is the requirement of photo identification to verify voter eligibility. The author believes that such measures are essential to maintain the integrity of elections and prevent ineligible voters from casting ballots, which they argue could be utilized to skew election results.

The author further critiques what they characterize as the Democratic Party's agenda to facilitate ineligible voters’ participation in elections as a means to manipulate outcomes. In their view, not only is the Democratic Party involved in these suspected efforts, but they also highlight the complicity of the Obama administration, Congress, and the federal court system. The author argues that these institutions are obstructing initiatives aimed at ensuring fair elections, thus exacerbating concerns regarding electoral integrity.

In light of these real and perceived threats to the democratic process, citizens are urged to take an active role in monitoring polling places during the upcoming election. The author calls on individuals to volunteer their time and efforts in order to safeguard against any possible voter fraud incidents. This grassroots involvement is positioned as crucial not only for the 2016 elections but for the future of American democracy itself.

Supporting these views is a notable endorsement of Donald Trump. Despite acknowledging his flaws, the author backs Trump for his stance against what they identify as a looming tyranny. This perspective adds an element of urgency to the commentary, depicting November 8, 2016, as a pivotal moment for American democracy.

Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson captured the attention and emotions of the American public with the release of the infamous ""Daisy"" advertisement. This ad, featuring a little girl counting petals on a daisy, quickly escalated into the deeply resonant image of a nuclear explosion, delivering a stark warning about the perils of war. The ad skillfully underscored the perceived dangers of Johnson's opponent, Barry Goldwater, portraying him as a reckless warmonger whose policies threatened the very fabric of peace and security for the nation.

Fast forward to the present day, political narratives echo the urgency of the past, albeit with varying contexts and actors. The aggressive nature of Johnson’s Vietnam policies starkly contrasts with his efforts to frame Goldwater in an unfavorable light. Today, as political campaigns gain momentum, many have begun to contemplate what a modern version of the ""Daisy"" ad might look like, particularly in light of Hillary Clinton's candidacy for the presidency.

In the wake of Clinton's tumultuous political career and her recent presidential run, speculation has arisen regarding the potential creation of a new ""Daisy"" advertisement aimed at highlighting her shortcomings as a candidate. The rumors suggest a landscape of desperation among Clinton's staff, desperate for a powerful narrative to reinvigorate a faltering campaign. Such an ad might seek to convey the narrative of trustworthiness, among other elements, crucial to winning public support—an element Clinton's candidacy has struggled with over the years.

In the broader media landscape, the portrayal of political figures, especially in the dynamic of the 2016 election cycle—where Ted Cruz and Donald Trump frequently clashed—has drawn criticism for its perceived slant and superficial analysis. The media's treatment of these candidates often resembles sensational headlines over substantial discussions, leading to an environment where deeper issues get buried beneath the noise of political theater.

The educational foundation for journalism schools also raises eyebrows, addressing the short memory and attention span of the modern American audience. Courses geared towards understanding audience engagement and retention reveal a stark reality: news consumers often overlook vital details in favor of readily digestible soundbites. This has cultivated an environment where the intricate nuances of political policies and their implications risk being overshadowed by more attention-grabbing moments.

An apparent bias within media coverage further complicates the landscape, with many observers believing that favorable portrayals of Democrats and liberal policies dominate the airwaves. This skew raises pertinent questions about the extent to which media sources serve a political agenda versus providing objective reporting. The complexities of political discourse are often lost in the relentless pursuit of ratings and viewer engagement.

Reflections on past presidential campaigns lend further credence to this argument. In 2008, remarks made by Barack Obama and Michelle Obama highlighted concerns over Hillary Clinton's credibility and competence. Their observations framed Clinton as someone whose reliability was up for scrutiny—a perspective that lingered through her candidacy and has persisted in political conversations. The criticisms levied by the Obamas have morphed into significant hurdles for Clinton, reinforcing perceptions of vulnerability and inconsistency in her political journey.

The prospect of a new ""Daisy"" advertisement potentially unraveling Clinton's record more comprehensively than its original counterpart fuels a crucial discussion on political communication. Where Johnson's ad implicitly warned of the dangers of a Goldwater presidency, a contemporary ""Daisy"" remake could unpack the many layers of struggle and failure that have characterized Clinton's public service career. Instead of a straightforward narrative, such a commercial could serve as a montage of moments that resonate emotionally with viewers—underscoring not only policy failures but also public missteps and the ensuing fallout.

As the political climate continues to evolve, the creation of a modern ""Daisy"" ad focused on Clinton's legacy would not merely be a nostalgic revival but a powerful indictment of a candidate who has faced persistent questioning of her integrity and capability. Such an advertisement could resonate deeply within a political landscape defined by rapid shifts in voter sentiment and the unyielding demand for authenticity in leadership.

The discussion surrounding a potential remake reflects not just a desire for accountability among political figures but also a yearning for storytelling that speaks to the electorate's concerns directly. Whether such creative ventures would yield the intended impact remains to be seen, but the necessity to adapt political messaging to resonate with contemporary audiences has never been clearer.

In conclusion, the legacy of the ""Daisy"" advertisement continues to reverberate, shedding light on the strategy of using emotional appeal to influence voter perception. As discussions around a modern remake unfold, the implications stretch beyond mere nostalgia, prompting a critical reflection on the importance of integrity, competency, and the undeniable influence of media narratives in shaping democratic discourse.

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Discussions surrounding President Barack Obama's birth certificate have intensified, with accusations directed primarily at the Democrats for employing intimidation tactics to stifle debate. Lynn Sweet, the Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times, has gone so far as to declare that questioning the birth certificate's validity amounts to racism. However, critics argue that this claim lacks substantive reasoning, suggesting that merely scrutinizing a black president should not automatically be equated with racial bias.

Detractors raise several points questioning the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate. They claim that the document presented may have been altered, pointing to discrepancies such as Obama's social security number, reportedly issued in Connecticut despite his lack of residency there. Furthermore, critics note that the hospital cited on the birth certificate did not exist at the time it was allegedly issued, and that multiple errors in the document could indicate possible falsification.

Despite these allegations, no original birth certificate has ever been released to the public. Instead, accusations of racism seem to overshadow legitimate inquiries into the matter, with terms like ""birther"" often used to dismiss dissenting voices. The article concludes with a sentiment of frustration regarding the ongoing reliance on labels rather than concrete evidence, reflecting the struggles faced by those seeking clarity on Obama’s birth documentation.

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Reference to a homophobic attack in May 2016 against Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old homosexual from Eastbourne.

- Woods' friend described him as a gentle person who was targeted violently.

- Mention of more liberal attitudes among some American Muslims regarding homosexuality.
- Claim that radical Islam and the gay community cannot coexist, as exemplified by Woods' experience.","**Homophobic Attack Highlights Tensions Within Communities**

In a disturbing reminder of the ongoing struggle against homophobia, Aaron Woods, a 26-year-old gay man from Eastbourne, fell victim to a violent attack in May 2016. The assault left him with a broken jaw and has reignited conversations about the intersections of identity and social intolerance. 

According to reports, Woods was confronted by an assailant who unleashed a barrage of homophobic slurs before physically attacking him. Witnesses recalled hearing the assailant shout ""Muslim stuff"" during the incident, which has raised eyebrows and ignited discussions about the relationship between the LGBTQ+ community and certain interpretations of Islamic law that condemn homosexuality.

Woods' friend spoke to the media, describing him as a gentle person who was unjustly targeted. ""Aaron is a loving guy who never harmed anyone,"" the friend lamented, emphasizing the senselessness of the violence he faced. This tragic encounter comes on the heels of a similar incident in Brighton, where a gay couple was assaulted by two men, underscoring a troubling trend of homophobic violence in the region.

In a statement, Sussex police confirmed that swift arrests were made following both attacks. They reported that the victims were recovering from their injuries, but the emotional scars may linger much longer. These incidents have prompted a broader discourse about the perceptions of safety within the gay community, particularly in areas with complex cultural dynamics.

Moreover, the incident has sparked debate about the compatibility of radical beliefs with the ethos of acceptance found in the LGBTQ+ community. Critics argue that strict interpretations of Islam inherently conflict with gay rights, citing Woods’ experience as evidence of this cultural rift.

Conversely, there are voices advocating for a more nuanced understanding, highlighting that many American Muslims hold liberal views regarding homosexuality. This perspective suggests that the conversation is far more complex than a monolithic clash of ideologies.

Ultimately, the attack on Aaron Woods reflects a painful reality: the need for greater dialogue and reconciliation between diverse communities. As society grapples with these issues, the imperative to foster a climate of respect and understanding remains paramount, ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, can live free from fear and violence.",-26.0,-38.0,399.0,-1.5294117647058822,-0.06516290726817042,412.0,-2.375,-0.09223300970873786
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

On a tense Saturday evening in St. Cloud, Minnesota, a man clad in a security uniform unleashed a wave of violence, stabbing nine shoppers while shouting ""Allahu Akbar,"" a phrase meaning ""God is the Greatest"" in Arabic. The chaotic scene unfolded at a local mall, leaving many in fear and shock. Authorities quickly identified the assailant as Dahir Adan, a Somali immigrant and practicing Muslim who reportedly posed a chilling question to at least one of his victims, asking whether they were Muslim before launching his attack.

As the investigation unfolded, members from the St. Cloud Somali-American community identified Adan as the perpetrator. In the wake of the attack, ISIS claimed Adan as one of its recruits, further complicating the narrative surrounding the incident and implicating broader issues of radicalization within Somali communities. The shocking event has reopened discussions about the rise of violent extremism and its connection to local immigrant populations.

In addition to the mall attack, the same day witnessed separate incidents across the nation, including a bomb placed at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey and an assault on police officers in New York by a Muslim man wielding a meat cleaver. Each of these instances contributed to a mounting sense of urgency regarding safety and security in public spaces.

Community officials from the Somali population expressed deep sympathy for Adan's family, characterizing him as a good man and an accomplished student. This portrayal starkly contrasts with the tragic events of that day, leaving many community leaders grappling with the implications of such violence attributed to one of their own.

The St. Cloud attack was abruptly halted when off-duty police officer Jason Falconer intervened, fatally shooting Adan as he continued to assault shoppers. Falconer was hailed as a hero by Mayor Dave Kleis, whose swift action prevented further loss of life and added another layer to the ongoing conversation about the role of law enforcement in countering such threats.

Minnesota has become a focal point in discussions about Somali refugees, as thousands have relocated to the state over the years. During President Obama's administration alone, nearly 10,000 Somali refugees found new homes in Minnesota. While the influx has contributed to the rich cultural diversity of the region, it has also resulted in heightened scrutiny, especially considering the historical ties between a subset of the community and terrorist organizations like ISIS and al-Shabaab.

The links between Minnesota's Somali community and these terror groups raised alarm bells nationwide, particularly following several convictions of individuals accused of collaborating with organizations that orchestrate acts of terror. Al-Shabaab, the militant group based in Somalia, has previously issued warnings about targeting shopping malls globally, with the Mall of America notably highlighted as a potential target. This alarming trend underscores growing concerns about the influence of radical ideologies within local enclaves.

Recent reports have also pointed to an increasing presence of the Islamic State in Somalia, bolstered by military support from Yemen. The widening reach of such organizations, coupled with incidents involving Somali refugees in Minnesota, has led to increased anxiety regarding the safety of local residents, particularly women who may be perceived as vulnerable targets.

Adding to this atmosphere of uncertainty, there have been documented cases of individuals making attempts to join ISIS, revealing ongoing dialogues between ISIS and al-Shabaab. These factors have only intensified fears surrounding the future implications of immigration and refugee policies on local security.

Discussions about potential future leadership have also entered the fray. The prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency sparked debates about a considerable rise in the number of Muslim refugees, further fueling concerns among critics about the potential ramifications on public safety. This political landscape has led some to advocate for alternatives, including voting for Donald Trump, as a perceived safeguard against the threats posed by terrorism.

In the wake of the St. Cloud stabbing incident, community dialogue has shifted significantly. Many are questioning how to balance the integration of immigrants and the commitment to upholding public safety. The Somali community, often in the crosshairs of national scrutiny, is trying to navigate a complex web where the actions of a few individuals can overshadow the positive contributions of many. Local leaders emphasize that the culture of their community is based on support, education, and resilience—a stark contrast to the violence that has gained attention.

As authorities continue to investigate the motivations behind Adan's actions, the implications for the Somali community in Minnesota will likely echo far beyond the immediate aftermath of the attack. Shared narratives of fear, resilience, and hope will play integral roles in shaping the community's response and its relations with the broader population.

The city of St. Cloud, while reeling from the events of that fateful day, must also confront the larger dialogue about immigrant safety, community integration, and the ideological battles that threaten to fracture societal bonds. In this climate of uncertainty, it remains clear that the path forward will require collective efforts to foster understanding and combat the forces that seek to perpetuate division and fear.",-72.0,-34.0,956.0,-1.8,-0.07531380753138076,945.0,-0.8717948717948718,-0.03597883597883598
Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

Ahmad Khan Rahami, the alleged perpetrator behind the bombings in New Jersey and New York City, has become emblematic of the troubling intersection of perceived victimhood and violent extremism. Reflected upon by some as part of a generation often branded as the ""everyone gets a trophy"" cohort, it raises critical questions about societal implications, effort standards, and the dichotomy between feelings of victimization and real-life accountability.

In 2011, Rahami, along with his father, took legal action against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police, claiming discrimination against their Muslim faith. This lawsuit became a focal point of Rahami’s grievances, illustrating his belief that local officials and community members engaged in a campaign of persecution against their family. The Rahami family's chicken restaurant, First American, was at the center of these allegations, where they contended that police sought to shutter their business through what they described as baseless tickets. 

The lawsuit alleged a series of grievances concerning noise complaints and police harassment. However, Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage vehemently denied these claims of discrimination, asserting that the police's actions were in response to legitimate noise complaints rather than motivated by ethnicity or religious beliefs.

The case against the police drew attention to Rahami’s narrative as a victim of systemic injustice, claiming that the prejudices he faced fueled a deeper sense of alienation and resentment. Notably, in light of the bombings discovered at a train station in Elizabeth just days before the attacks, one cannot help but question whether Rahami's history of seeking recognition as a persecuted individual influenced his subsequent violent actions.

This unprecedented tragedy begs the larger question regarding how grievances expressed through legal avenues might spiral into dire consequences. While the connections between victimhood mentality and radicalization are complex, Rahami's trajectory showcases a potential link between perceived injustices and emergent violence. 

As society grapples with these troubling narratives, understanding the psychology behind such actions may become more critical than ever. As the “everyone gets a trophy generation” label continues to linger, the implications regarding both effort and standards relative to feelings of victimization must be revisited. The underlying problems illuminated by Rahami's case encourage further discourse on how grievances, real or perceived, shape individual actions against the backdrop of community dynamics and responses.

Ahmad Khan Rahami’s story serves as a crucial reminder of the intricate relationship between identity, societal treatment, and the radicalization that can stem from feeling marginalized. As investigations proceed, the implications of his actions raise significant concerns surrounding how narratives of victimhood can lead to disastrous outcomes, pushing society to reflect on the careful balance that must be maintained between recognition of genuine grievances and fostering accountability among individuals.",-38.0,-42.0,485.0,-2.533333333333333,-0.07835051546391752,518.0,-2.625,-0.08108108108108109
Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}","- For decades, employers in America have threatened to relocate businesses to influence voting behavior.

For decades, the practice of corporate leaders threatening to relocate their businesses has been a strategic tool used to influence voter behavior across the United States. This tactic aims to manipulate the electorate by implying that political decisions could adversely affect job retention and workforce stability. However, historical outcomes suggest that even when employers’ voting preferences are met, employees often face undesirable consequences. These consequences can result in job outsourcing, stagnant wages, and an erosion of regulatory enforcement that ultimately leaves workers worse off.

In the current political climate, this trend continues to be spotlighted by prominent business executives. Recently, Andy Puzder, the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, has made headlines for his overt threats to the economy tied to the upcoming elections. Puzder has warned that if a Democrat wins the election, it could lead to significant economic downturns, capturing attention for the high stakes associated with political decisions in corporate America.

Puzder’s concerns aren’t solely limited to threats; he has articulated broader views on how economic policies affect labor dynamics. His previous commentary has focused on automation, suggesting that increased labor costs, which he associates with Democratic policies, will inevitably lead to a more automated workforce. He has publicly expressed admiration for automated restaurant models, such as Eatsa, which minimize human interaction in the ordering process, highlighting his intention to reshape the customer experience while reducing the number of employees.

The implications of Puzder's employment and wage strategies are substantial. He argues that raising the minimum wage, a staple of progressive political agendas, can result in fewer job opportunities, a position that resonates with certain business interests but raises concerns for low-income workers. With approximately 20,000 employees under his leadership, Puzder appears to be targeting not just the political landscape but the very workers that could be affected by decisions surrounding minimum wage laws. By attempting to align his staff and other minimum wage earners against their likely interests, Puzder’s actions may further complicate the economic realities for these individuals.

To publicly share his viewpoints, Puzder maintains a blog where he discusses themes of capitalism and politics. However, there remains uncertainty regarding his employees’ perceptions of his interpretation of capitalism. The dichotomy between the successes of corporate leadership and the financial realities faced by workers under Puzder’s management paints a stark picture—despite growing profits and substantial personal earnings for Puzder, these gains do not trickle down to his employees.

As the political landscape continues to evolve with the approaching election, it seems likely that Puzder will persist in his efforts to automate operations, placing profit maximization above the welfare of his employees. The predictions suggest a trajectory where, regardless of electoral outcomes, corporate strategies aimed at automation will overshadow the immediate needs and job security of countless workers. 

This new wave of automation and strategic corporate policies reflects a broader issue in America: the ongoing struggle between job security, automation, and wage policies. The threatened relocation of businesses and the profound influence of individuals like Puzder on the political process expose a complex relationship where corporate interests may not align with those of the workforce. 

In reviewing Puzder's stance and the implications for his employees, it becomes clear that the challenge ahead includes balancing corporate profitability with the economic stability of workers.

Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

As the nation gears up for a significant election, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has announced that it is investigating fresh evidence relating to Hillary Clinton's controversial use of a private email server. This development comes during an inquiry into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton’s close aide, Huma Abedin. The investigation reveals potentially consequential information that may embroil both women and reignite discussions around the Obama-era scandal that has remained a focal point of political discourse.

Recent reports indicate that a laptop shared between Weiner and Abedin may house “tens of thousands of emails” from Abedin’s professional correspondences, which may include forwarded emails from Clinton’s account that were not previously turned over to the FBI. The contents of this laptop could prove to be pivotal; if the emails are determined to be work-related or classified, it raises serious implications for both Clinton and Abedin. Specifically, it could lead to accusations of lying to the FBI, a federal offense that carries the risk of prosecution for both individuals.

The gravity of these findings is underscored by the timing of the FBI's announcement; the agency released a letter detailing the new developments just 11 days before the presidential election, highlighting the urgency and seriousness of the evidence that has surfaced. The announcement has raised eyebrows and is likely to affect public perception in the days leading up to the vote.

The saga of Clinton's emails had its roots in earlier investigations conducted by the FBI. On July 5, 2016, FBI Director James Comey publicly presented findings related to Clinton's email practices, noting significant evidence against her but ultimately choosing not to recommend criminal charges. Comey’s decision sparked dissent within the FBI and among individuals monitoring the investigation, as many agents believed that Clinton should be held accountable for her actions. Reports from high-ranking FBI officials suggested a consensus within the agency in favor of revoking Clinton's security clearance, with many advocating for prosecution based on the evidence amassed.

This investigation took a further turn on October 17, 2016, when updates surfaced, revealing a comprehensive 100-page summary of the ongoing probes. This document claimed that a high-ranking State Department official had pressured the FBI into declassifying Clinton's email contents. In exchange for this declassification, the FBI was reportedly promised an increased number of agents assigned to foreign posts. Such revelations have fueled speculation about the interplay between government agencies and how political considerations may have shaped the nature of the FBI’s findings.

The investigation also put a spotlight on a group of State Department officials referred to as “The Shadow Government.” This faction was reportedly involved in discussions related to Freedom of Information requests tied to Clinton. The inner workings of this group warrant scrutiny, as their activities may have conflicted with the principles of transparency that govern federal agencies.

Compounding the controversy surrounding Clinton's emails, further updates indicated that a significant donor had contributed nearly $500,000 to the campaign of the wife of an FBI official who was actively investigating the emails. Such financial connections raise ethical questions about the integrity of the investigation and whether it may have been compromised by outside interests seeking to influence the outcome.

In a critical development linked to the matter, Paul Combetta, an IT specialist connected to the deletion of emails from Clinton's server, was granted immunity by the Justice Department in exchange for his cooperation. This immunity arrangement has sparked debates about accountability and whether such steps will curtail future investigative avenues, especially in light of evidence suggesting the deleted emails included communications between Clinton and President Obama. If proven, this connection could suggest that both politicians misled various government agencies during the investigation.

The narrative surrounding Clinton's email server has been further complicated by leaked correspondence from her team. These emails reflect discussions among Clinton's aides concerning strategies to manage the public narrative and media coverage regarding her private server's use. The focus on controlling the narrative indicates an awareness of the implications that could arise from the ongoing scrutiny.

Despite the marked absence of intent to pursue criminal charges against Clinton as articulated by Comey, a robust body of evidence suggests that Clinton may have had direct involvement in the deletion of emails. This aspect raises significant questions about the integrity of her defense and the broader implications for her political career. The allegations have incited claims that the White House may have exerted influence over the FBI investigation, with the alleged intent to safeguard Clinton while potentially concealing communications with President Obama.

To contextualize these revelations, a documented timeline tracing the key events related to Clinton's email saga offers insights into how this situation has evolved. Events gathered momentum beginning March 2, 2015, when The New York Times first reported on Clinton's email usage, leading ultimately to the deletions that raise ethical and legal questions, culminating in the investigation into Combetta’s actions.

As the FBI continues to sift through this new trove of emails and evidence, the political ramifications of its findings are likely to resonate deeply throughout the election period. The scrutiny placed upon both Clinton and Abedin, amid allegations of deception and potential breaches of the law, could influence the electorate's view and alter the trajectory of the upcoming elections.

The intertwining of personal relationships, political ambitions, and alleged improprieties forms the backdrop against which this investigation is set. With each new piece of evidence brought to light, the complexity of Clinton's email scandal deepens, prompting renewed calls for accountability and transparency.

As the FBI’s investigation progresses, the nation will be watching closely, anticipating how these revelations may reshape the political landscape. The implications of this scandal extend far beyond the individuals at the center, reflecting on institutional integrity, governance, and public trust in the political process. With the spotlight on the upcoming election, the relationship between these findings and the choices facing voters becomes ever more pronounced. The narrative surrounding Hillary Clinton's email server saga remains a critical chapter in the ongoing discussion of accountability within political circles, the responsibilities of public officials, and the integrity of the electoral process itself. 

In the weeks to come, as both parties engage in their final preparations for the election, the role played by these revelations and the FBI’s investigation will be a focal point of debate, discussion, and possible fallout. The outcome of the election may very well hinge on public response to these new developments, as well as the perceptions voters hold regarding honesty, integrity, and accountability in their leaders. The implications of the FBI's findings are significant, and they serve as a reminder of the complexities that govern the intersection of politics, law, and public trust.",-6.0,6.0,2216.0,-0.09375,-0.002707581227436823,1271.0,0.14285714285714285,0.004720692368214005
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, once a staunch advocate for an open borders policy to accept large numbers of Syrian refugees, is now re-evaluating her stance in light of growing public concern over rising crime rates. This policy, intended to uphold humanitarian principles, has led to a significant uptick in crime, with thousands of sexual assaults and violent crimes reported across German cities in recent years.

As dissatisfaction with the implications of her immigration policies mounted, Merkel faced a considerable electoral defeat for her conservative Democrat party, signaling a shift in public sentiment toward migration. In a candid acknowledgment of her government’s past decisions, Merkel expressed regrets about her approach, suggesting that the migrant crisis might have been avoidable. She characterized the concept of multiculturalism as a “living lie,” reflecting a belief that the integration of diverse cultures posed challenges to social cohesion.

During a speech at her party’s annual conference, Merkel articulated the need for Germany to manage migration effectively by regulating its influx. Although she emphasized the importance of reducing the number of incoming refugees, she stopped short of endorsing a specific limit on arrivals. This measured approach underscores her recognition that, while migration is a complex and multi-faceted issue, it requires strategic governance.

Merkel reinforced her commitment to managing and limiting migration at various levels—German, European, and global. The challenges of integrating newcomers with potentially incompatible ideologies into Western values were highlighted as significant concerns that must be addressed. Her remarks suggest a growing awareness of the delicate balance between compassion and security in immigration policy.

Moreover, Merkel offered a cautionary note directed toward the United States, where similar challenges related to immigration and integration persist. The lessons learned from Germany’s experiences with refugee acceptance may provide critical insights as other nations navigate their own immigration dilemmas.

As Germany reassesses its approach to migration in the wake of these challenges, it remains to be seen how Merkel’s reflections will shape future policies and foster a more harmonious society while addressing the concerns of its citizens.",-2.0,-6.0,390.0,-0.15384615384615385,-0.005128205128205128,396.0,-0.42857142857142855,-0.015151515151515152
Fake_36-Webpage,"DISGUSTING! Because Of Hillary & Obama, NY Terrorist Will Get Better Treatment Than US Vets! ⋆ Freedom Daily","8.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology.

In a striking reminder of the ongoing challenges facing veterans’ healthcare in the United States, a recent case has prompted outrage regarding the treatment of a terrorist in comparison to the nation's former servicemen and women. The individual in question, Ahmad Rahami, was responsible for planting and detonating explosives in New Jersey and New York City, and now he is set to receive better medical care than many veterans. 

This disparity in healthcare has reignited criticism of the Veteran Administration's (VA) long troubled history. A scandal that came to light in 2014 revealed that numerous veterans had been subjected to lengthy waiting lists, preventing them from receiving timely medical attention. This scandal brought to the forefront systemic issues that have persisted over the years, leading to alarming consequences for those who have served the nation.

In a campaign speech, former President Donald Trump brought attention to this controversial situation, praising law enforcement for their successful apprehension of Rahami. During his remarks, Trump underlined that the terrorist would be afforded access to top-notch medical care, complete with a modern hospital room and an outstanding legal defense. His statements pointedly contrasted the care Rahami will receive with the suffering faced by many veterans.

The statistics speak volumes: over 300,000 veterans have died while waiting for care due to the inadequacies of the system. Many others have faced severe mental health crises leading to suicides linked to the lack of support and resources available to them. This ongoing tragedy raises critical questions about the government's commitment to those who have worn the uniform in service to their country.

Critics are now challenging the ethical implications of providing superior medical treatment to a convicted terrorist while veterans languish with inadequate care. The sense of frustration is palpable, as many Americans are left questioning the priorities of a government that appears to prioritize the healthcare needs of a terrorist over those of veterans who have sacrificed to protect the nation.

The article encapsulates a deep-seated skepticism regarding the federal government’s values and commitment to its veterans. More than just a matter of healthcare, this situation reveals a broader societal concern about justice and moral responsibility. As the nation grapples with these complex issues, the ongoing plight of veterans underscores an urgent need for a reevaluation of healthcare priorities—and a recommitment to those who have honorably served the country.",13.0,-3.0,431.0,0.7647058823529411,0.030162412993039442,444.0,-0.1875,-0.006756756756756757
Fake_37-Webpage,DESPICABLE! Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS ⋆ Freedom Daily,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more.

In a dramatic turn of events, Jason Falconer, a National Rifle Association (NRA)-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, thwarted an ISIS terrorist attack in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Falconer’s decisive action involved shooting the assailant, who had already stabbed eight individuals in a terrifying spree that could have claimed more lives if not for his intervention.

Falconer operates Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc., which emphasizes gun safety and advocates for the protection of Second Amendment rights. His experience and training played a crucial role in his ability to respond effectively to the emergency, drawing praise from the community and beyond. In the wake of the attack, Falconer is being hailed as a hero for his quick thinking and bravery in what was an undoubtedly chaotic situation.

However, Falconer’s reputation and profession come under potential threat as political tensions rise. Hillary Clinton, a prominent figure in the ongoing presidential race, has expressed intentions to target those in the firearms industry, specifically seeking to put Falconer’s business at risk if she were to be elected. Clinton's campaign has outlined plans to eliminate the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which presently shields firearms manufacturers and retailers from frivolous lawsuits.

This proposed policy change has sparked heated debate, especially following Falconer’s recent heroics, as opponents frame reforms like those proposed by Clinton as direct threats to Second Amendment rights. Critics argue that her claims surrounding the PLCAA—that it offers ""immunity"" to gunmakers and dealers—are misleading and fail to acknowledge the nuances of the legislation. Many in the firearms community, including Falconer, view these initiatives as detrimental not only to their livelihoods but also to public safety and individual rights.

For Falconer, this situation is particularly personal. He has dedicated his life to not only serving as a police officer but also to educating others on responsible gun ownership through his training academy. His commitment to protecting citizens, showcased during the attack, exemplifies the potential for responsible gun owners to make a significant difference during crises. 

Clinton's rhetoric around gun control and the firearms industry continues to rally staunch opposition, particularly among advocates for the Second Amendment. Many see her proposed actions as an infringement on constitutional rights, igniting fears that such policies could undermine the very principles she claims to uphold. Falconer’s actions have become a powerful narrative in this debate, pushing back against calls for more stringent regulations on firearm ownership.

As public discourse heats up around gun rights and regulations, more voices are joining the fray, urging citizens to recognize the implications of the current political climate on their rights. Political advocates are rallying not just for Falconer’s profession but for the rights of all Americans to bear arms responsibly.

The fallout from the St. Cloud attack and Falconer’s subsequent actions could alter the landscape of the firearms debate leading into the election season. With Clinton positioning herself as a potential front-runner, the direction of gun rights in America hangs in the balance, with many viewing her candidacy as a direct threat to the liberties afforded by the Second Amendment.

As the nation prepares for the upcoming presidential election, the implications of Falconer’s commendable response to violence and the political movements that seek to reframe such narratives will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping public opinion and policy regarding firearms in the years to come.",-11.0,-7.0,574.0,-0.4782608695652174,-0.01916376306620209,656.0,-0.28,-0.010670731707317074

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

In a political landscape where public perception is pivotal, the health of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has emerged as a focal point in media discussions and recent presidential polls. A new survey reveals a significant shift in how voters view Clinton's health, with over 40% of registered voters now rating her health as ""below average"" or ""very poor."" This marks a notable rise from just 26% in late August, indicating growing apprehension among the electorate.

Conversely, evaluations of former President Donald Trump's health have made a marked improvement, with 36% of voters rating his health as ""above average"" or ""excellent."" Only 22% of respondents hold a similarly favorable view of Clinton’s health. While the percentage of voters who consider Clinton’s health as ""average"" has remained constant at 28%, the escalating concerns surrounding her well-being cannot be overlooked.

The alarm surrounding Clinton's health appears to be fueled by various factors, including her age—she is currently 68—and an overall perception that she appears older than her years. Approximately 80% of voters acknowledge being informed about Clinton’s potential medical issues, indicating that these concerns are not confined to political circles but resonate broadly with the public.

Speculation regarding her health has heightened due to reports of Clinton taking Coumadin, a medication commonly used to prevent blood clots. Additionally, her association with Provigil—a drug indicated for serious neurological conditions—has sparked further discussions about her health. These findings have compounded worries about her fitness for the demands of a presidential campaign, particularly when coupled with observed instances where Clinton has seemingly struggled physically.

Incidents such as Clinton appearing to pass out and her stumbling during public appearances have generated extensive media coverage, leaving many voters worried about her capabilities. Furthermore, alarming footage depicting Clinton being physically assisted at various events has circulated widely, intensifying speculation about her health and vitality.

One particularly concerning moment occurred when she fainted at the 9/11 Memorial. This incident was captured on camera, prompting not only immediate concerns about her well-being but also a series of conspiracy theories. Since then, several videos documenting her struggles have been removed from platforms like YouTube, leading to accusations that her campaign is trying to obscure the truth about her health status.

In light of the rising health concerns, observers have noted low turnout rates at Clinton's campaign rallies. Critics suggest this might be a strategic move to limit public exposure to her during appearances, pointing to a potential acknowledgment of her physical limitations. Such considerations have undoubtedly influenced public perception and sentiment regarding her overall candidacy.

Clinton’s cough has become a particularly notorious element of her public persona, raising alarm among voters and prompting an increase in speculation regarding her health. What was once a passing observation has evolved into a fixture of concern in the minds of many Americans, further complicating her campaign message.

As the 2024 election cycle looms, the implications of Clinton's health perceptions could be far-reaching. With more voters wary of her physical condition, political strategists face an uphill battle in reassuring the electorate about her capabilities. Addressing these concerns could prove to be as crucial as the policies she advocates throughout her campaign.

In essence, the dialogue surrounding Hillary Clinton’s health is shaping up to play a key role in how voters perceive her candidacy. It remains to be seen how the campaign will navigate these discussions in the coming months and what steps, if any, they will take to alleviate public fears. As voter concerns intensify and health-related topics remain at the forefront, Clinton's ability to effectively communicate her fitness and readiness for office could very well be the deciding factor in her political future. 

Overall, how Clinton addresses these health perceptions could determine not only her public image but also her viability as a serious contender in the already competitive political landscape. As the election approaches, maintaining a firm grasp on both health discussions and campaign initiatives will be paramount for Clinton and her team. The challenge lies ahead, and with public opinion shifting rapidly, the response must be both swift and strategic to regain voter confidence.",-11.0,9.0,765.0,-0.36666666666666664,-0.01437908496732026,792.0,0.3,0.011363636363636364

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House.

In this tell-all account, Kyle reveals troubling insights into Hillary's behavior and her attitude towards others, painting a controversial picture of the former First Lady and Secretary of State.

Kyle details her experiences with the couple, including claims that the Clintons used racial epithets and held contentious political views. One particularly striking incident described in the book involves Hillary’s outburst during a special needs Easter egg hunt. According to Kyle, Hillary expressed clear frustration with the event, reportedly saying, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”

The narrative further explores Hillary Clinton's perspective on her home state of Arkansas. Kyle asserts that Hillary viewed Arkansas residents with disdain, referring to them as “ignorant hillbillies” due to her own middle-class upbringing in Illinois. Despite this apparent contempt for her surroundings, Hillary notably campaigned as a lifelong Yankees fan during her time in New York, indicating a complicated relationship with her roots.

The book also touches on Bill Clinton's political decisions, specifically his choice not to seek reelection in 1990. This decision, according to Kyle, was driven by a desire to escape the confines of what they deemed a “small Southern state.” 

As *Hillary: The Other Woman* gains traction, it is expected to spark significant discussion regarding the Clintons’ past actions and perceptions, raising questions about their legacy and the implications of their personal beliefs on their political careers.",-10.0,-6.0,337.0,-0.7692307692307693,-0.02967359050445104,316.0,-0.6666666666666666,-0.0189873417721519

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

In a groundbreaking ruling, a Massachusetts judge has approved a special law that permits black males to flee from police without facing legal repercussions. This decision, which received backing from the Supreme Court, has ignited a wave of concerns regarding public safety and the role of law enforcement in the state.

Reactions to the ruling have ranged from confusion to frustration, as many question the implications of such a law. Critics argue that this move appears to neglect the complexities of police work and the potential risks to citizens. By allowing individuals to flee without consequences, the ruling raises the specter of increased danger for the public, especially in a climate where the safety of both citizens and law enforcement is paramount.

Historically, fleeing from a police officer has been treated as a significant offense, often amounting to ""reasonable suspicion"" that could lead to detention and investigation. This foundational principle aimed to support police efforts in maintaining law and order. The judge's new ruling, however, has effectively undermined this principle, significantly hampering the police's ability to protect and serve their communities.

The ruling has drawn particular concern from law enforcement agencies, who voice frustrations over the added challenges they now face while performing their duties. Officers have always operated in a high-risk environment, and with the advent of this law, there is a growing fear that their ability to manage confrontations and uphold public safety may be further compromised. The inherent dangers faced by police officers cannot be overstated; every day they risk their lives to maintain peace and protect citizens. The notion that individuals can now legally evade their authority raises serious questions about the effectiveness of policing and the ensuing ramifications for communities across Massachusetts.

Amidst the outrage, some have pointed out the irony of the situation. The prevailing sentiment expresses that only those committed to obeying the law are likely to comply with police directives. There is a growing concern that individuals with criminal intentions may see this new law as an opportunity to exploit the system, accentuating the divide between law-abiding citizens and those who would seek to evade law enforcement.

As debate surrounding this groundbreaking ruling continues, one thing remains clear: the implications are far-reaching, and the community will be left grappling with the issues of public safety and law enforcement autonomy for the foreseeable future. The balancing act between promoting justice and ensuring the safety of citizens is growing ever more complex, with this ruling serving as a pivotal moment in Massachusetts’ legal landscape.",-13.0,10.0,477.0,-0.4642857142857143,-0.027253668763102725,479.0,0.5882352941176471,0.020876826722338204
Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s.

In a significant revelation following a crushing defeat in Berlin’s local elections, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed a willingness to revise her open migrant policy if given the opportunity to turn back time. Her candid acknowledgment highlights the shifting public sentiment surrounding refugee policies in Germany, as her party faces growing scrutiny over their approach to immigration.

Merkel's admission came in the aftermath of the Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) disappointing electoral performance, which she described as “bitter,” taking full responsibility for the party's losses. The results underscore a notable shift in the political landscape, reflecting an increasing anti-migrant sentiment that has been gaining momentum across Germany. This sentiment has been further intensified by the rising influence of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has capitalized on public fears relating to migration and security issues.

The Chancellor's willingness to reconsider her stance on migration policies marks a significant moment in her political career, indicating an awareness of the mounting dissatisfaction among constituents. “It’s vital to understand the public's concerns regarding refugee policy,” Merkel stated, acknowledging the need for a more responsive approach to the evolving opinions of the electorate. However, many political analysts view her comments as more rhetoric than a commitment to real change. They point out her hesitation to adopt substantial alterations to existing migration policies.

Despite the growing chorus for change, Merkel has remained firm in her opposition to the calls from her Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), which has proposed capping the annual migrant intake at 200,000 and prioritizing Christian migrants over Muslims. Merkel firmly rejected these suggestions, reaffirming her commitment to the principles of her party and suggesting that they do not align with her vision for immigration in Germany. This refusal has led to tensions within her coalition, as CSU leader Horst Seehofer has threatened to withdraw support from Merkel as the 2017 campaign nears. 

The background of rising anti-migrant sentiment is concerning, particularly in light of incidents of terrorism and crimes associated with migrants that have shaken public trust and safety perceptions in Germany. The intersection of these issues with Merkel's progressive immigration policies adds to the complexity of the political situation as the country moves towards the next federal elections. Analysts suggest that Merkel's legacy is increasingly at stake, especially as she faces potential backlash similar to that experienced by certain American political figures amid anti-immigrant sentiments in their own countries.

Looking ahead, Merkel's challenges are apparent, and her political future may hinge on her ability to balance progressive migration strategies with the increasing desire for stricter controls from her coalition partners and the electorate. As the landscape became more fractious with the AfD gaining ground, it has become evident that Merkel's previous commitments to open-door policies may contribute to significant electoral challenges moving forward.

With public sentiment increasingly swayed against the backdrop of instability and fear, it remains to be seen how Merkel will navigate the upcoming federal elections, as well as whether she will adapt her policies to align more closely with the prevailing concerns of the German populace in the face of her historical stance on migrant integration.",-14.0,11.0,557.0,-0.5,-0.025134649910233394,598.0,0.6111111111111112,0.01839464882943144
Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims

In a shocking incident in Sundsvall, Sweden, Abdullah, a Somali asylum seeker with a history of violent crimes and multiple convictions, has been accused of brutally assaulting his pregnant wife. The assault occurred after Abdullah returned home to find his wife's niece still present, despite his previous orders for her to leave the premises. This incident has revived discussions surrounding the interpretation of religious texts and their impact on domestic violence.

Abdullah's actions were described as heinous, with reports indicating he physically attacked his wife, kicking her in the head and stomach. The violence escalated as he humiliated her further by pouring beer on her and urinating on her. Such behavior has drawn widespread condemnation, not only for its brutality but also for its roots in a selective interpretation of religious teachings.

The article draws attention to Quran 4:34, which discusses the treatment of disobedient wives. This particular verse has been cited in discussions of domestic governance within some interpretations of Islam. Critics argue that, while the full context of this verse emphasizes compassion and resolution, it has been misappropriated by individuals like Abdullah to justify acts of violence and control over their spouses. The troubling interpretations of these teachings raise questions about the dangers of selectively adhering to religious texts that can fuel domestic abuse.

Abdullah's case is not isolated; it reflects a crisis where vulnerable individuals seeking refuge may bring with them patterns of behavior that clash with the values and laws of their host country. Arriving in Sweden five years ago, Abdullah has been supported by welfare benefits throughout his time in the country, raising concerns about the implications of supporting asylum seekers with criminal pasts.

The community response to Abdullah's actions signifies a critical stance against domestic violence, with advocates emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach to address the complex intersection of cultural practices, religious interpretations, and societal norms. Local leaders are calling for educational programs to help prevent such violence and to promote healthy relationships.

As this case unfolds, the commitment of Swedish authorities to ensure safety and justice for victims of domestic violence will be closely monitored. The broader implications of this situation go beyond Abdullah's actions, encompassing the responsibilities of host nations and the need for dialogue around gender equality and respect within the context of diverse cultural backgrounds.

The violence faced by Abdullah's wife, especially given her pregnancy, highlights a broader concern regarding the treatment of women in various social settings. Advocates for women's rights are urging a re-examination of support structures and interventions that can prevent such abuses from occurring in the first place.

The story of Abdullah's violent actions not only raises alarm about individual accountability but also serves as a reminder of the need for ongoing community dialogue regarding the importance of interpretation, understanding, and respect within marriages, irrespective of differing backgrounds.",-28.0,-47.0,503.0,-1.2727272727272727,-0.055666003976143144,539.0,-2.473684210526316,-0.08719851576994433
Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

In a move that has sparked controversy across the state, Pennsylvania Republicans are advancing House Bill 29, a piece of legislation that would permit non-residents to observe polling places and challenge voters on Election Day. Critics of the bill argue it could open the door to voter intimidation, potentially disrupting the electoral process and undermining democratic norms.

The proposed legislation is notable for allowing individuals who do not reside in Pennsylvania to challenge the legitimacy of voters at the polls. This aspect of the bill raises significant alarm among civil rights advocates, who warn that it could lead to discriminatory practices based on race, religion, or other personal characteristics. Adam Gitlin, a representative from the Brennan Center for Justice, articulated concerns that such challenges could result in longer wait times at polling places and dissuade voters from casting their ballots altogether.

The motivations behind the bill are closely aligned with rhetoric previously espoused by former President Donald Trump, who has frequently claimed that there is widespread voter fraud necessitating increased vigilance at polling locations. Trump has actively encouraged his supporters to serve as poll watchers, asserting that these individuals are essential to prevent alleged election rigging. The introduction of House Bill 29 appears to capitalize on this narrative, providing a legal framework for supporters to monitor and challenge voters under the guise of election integrity.

Moreover, the Pennsylvania Republicans have made the strategic decision to amend the bill so that it would take effect immediately upon passage, bypassing a traditional 60-day waiting period, thereby accelerating its implementation in light of the impending election. This rapid execution raises additional concerns among opponents who fear that the immediate application of the law could intensify political tensions and further complicate an already contentious electoral landscape.

As the state gears up for a highly competitive election, many observers fear that the provisions of House Bill 29 could have disproportionate impacts, particularly benefiting Republicans and enhancing the potential for voter intimidation tactics. Critics believe that enabling non-resident poll observers to challenge voters could create an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty at polling locations, which, in turn, may influence overall election outcomes.

Amid this brewing controversy, the bill's proponents argue that it seeks to protect the integrity of the electoral process. They assert that allowing individuals to challenge voters will help identify instances of fraud, despite a lack of substantial evidence supporting such claims. However, the legislation has prompted significant backlash from a variety of advocacy groups who emphasize that any form of voter intimidation undermines the principle of fair and free elections.

As the legislative session progresses, House Bill 29 has become a focal point in the debate over voter rights and electoral integrity in Pennsylvania. The unfolding situation highlights deeper national tensions regarding the casting of ballots and the perceived need for safeguarding the voting process.

In a climate where the protection of democratic practices is increasingly under scrutiny, the implications of House Bill 29 may reverberate far beyond Pennsylvania’s borders. The ongoing discourse regarding the balance between poll security and voter access underscores a critical juncture in American democracy, prompting vital questions about who is granted the power to determine the validity of voters and the potential consequences of such authority.",-19.0,-24.0,545.0,-1.1176470588235294,-0.03486238532110092,601.0,-1.263157894736842,-0.03993344425956739

[I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that’s what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",http://freedomdaily.com/female-muslim-american-olympian-bashes-u-s-a-goes-off-the-hinges-about-why-america-sucks/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ibtihaj-Muhammad.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Ibtihaj Muhammad, an acclaimed American Olympian fencer, has become a significant figure not only in sports but also in discussions surrounding race, identity, and the impact of hate crimes in the United States. As the first athlete to compete in the Olympics while wearing a hijab, Muhammad has encountered her share of challenges, particularly concerning her feelings of insecurity stemming from racial incidents.

In a recent statement, she recounted a troubling experience where she felt unsafe after being followed home from practice. This incident has prompted Muhammad to shed light on the increasing prevalence of hate crimes, especially those directed against Muslim communities. She emphasized that the seriousness of these crimes cannot be understated, referencing the alarming trend of shootings and hostile rhetoric aimed at Muslim families.

Despite her advocacy, Muhammad faced criticism regarding her portrayal of America, particularly around the notion of the country being ""Islamophobic."" She highlighted that, statistically, hate crimes against Jewish individuals are significantly higher than those directed at Muslims, suggesting that discussions on hate crimes should be more nuanced and fact-driven.

In what has become a contentious topic, some critics have questioned Muhammad’s commitment to the United States. They suggested that if she views the country negatively, perhaps she should consider relocating to a Muslim-majority nation. This perspective has sparked a debate about the responsibilities of public figures in reflecting national pride while navigating their identities.

Muhammad responded to such criticisms by asserting that Muslims often experience better living conditions in America than in many Muslim-majority countries. Her comments have reignited conversations about the realities faced by immigrant communities in the United States and the importance of understanding the complex threads of identity that weave through the fabric of American life.

As these discussions continue, Muhammad remains at the forefront, using her platform to advocate for understanding and respect for all individuals, irrespective of their racial or religious backgrounds.",-23.0,-30.0,370.0,-1.5333333333333334,-0.062162162162162166,365.0,-2.3076923076923075,-0.0821917808219178
Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

In a gripping turn of events, protests erupted in Charlotte after a black police officer shot a black suspect, leading to a scene marked by violence and disregard for public safety. The aftermath of this incident revealed not only the frustrations surrounding police actions but also the disappointing conduct of the protesters, who demonstrated a disheartening lack of respect for the very principles they claim to uphold.

As the protests escalated, what was initially an expression of anger quickly devolved into chaos. Video footage captured horrifying moments where protestors mocked an injured police officer, reveling in a macabre display that left many onlookers stunned. Such behavior raises serious questions regarding the integrity of the movement and the values its supporters purport to represent. Instead of promoting constructive dialogue or seeking productive resolutions, these so-called advocates resorted to looting and rioting, actions that overshadow the very message they aimed to communicate.

Critics of the protests have voiced their disdain, labeling the demonstrators ""thugs"" for their violent actions and the contempt they showed towards law enforcement. This unfortunate label is not unfounded; the unruly behavior observed during the protests is a stark contradiction to the peace and unity that many claim to seek. It appears that logic has been discarded for an emotional outburst, causing protestors to act without an understanding of the deeper issues at hand.

The support that movements like Black Lives Matter (BLM) receive is often portrayed as a noble cause aimed at highlighting systemic injustices. Yet, the reality, as seen in Charlotte, indicates that backing such movements may contribute to an environment of lawlessness and instability in urban communities. The rhetoric of BLM supporters fanning the flames of dissent does nothing to foster understanding, and its impact often reflects poorly not just on individual protestors, but on the wider community, including all black individuals who strive for dignity and respect.

Descriptive language paints a troubling picture of the BLM supporters; words like ""irresponsible,"" ""violent,"" and ""harmful"" emerge, underscoring a perception that these activists, in their fervor, bring more chaos than clarity. The tragedy lies in the movement’s potential to unite people against genuine injustices, yet that potential becomes clouded by the very actions that alienate the broader public. It begs the question: do the protesters truly comprehend the cause they profess to champion?

In the face of aggression and hostility, it is crucial to reflect on how we react to those in distress, particularly law enforcement officers, who are often caught in the crossfire of such protests. If I were to witness an officer in need, my instinct would be to extend support rather than to mock or deride. This reaction reflects a fundamental value that should be prevalent in society—empathy for those who serve and protect, even amid challenging circumstances. Yet, the response from the crowd stands in stark contrast to this ideal, raising alarm bells about the moral compass of those engaged in these acts.

As the unrest continues to unfold, it is imperative for individuals and communities to engage in self-reflection about the implications of supporting movements steeped in discord. The focus should remain on fostering constructive dialogue that addresses the roots of societal issues without resorting to violence. Instead of vilifying the institution of law enforcement, it is vital to promote positive changes that can lead to a more just society, one built on mutual respect rather than division.

Ultimately, the events in Charlotte belong not just to a single night of unrest but echo a broader struggle for understanding and representation. By adopting a mindset that encourages respect for the complex challenges faced by both community members and police officers, we can hope to steer the narratives in a direction that uplifts all individuals—not just a select few. In this regard, the responsibility lies with every one of us to reject violence and chaos, and instead embrace a path that prioritizes dialogue, empathy, and constructive action.",-83.0,-37.0,669.0,-2.4411764705882355,-0.12406576980568013,745.0,-1.48,-0.049664429530201344
Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

In his final address as President, Barack Obama took center stage at the United Nations General Assembly, reinforcing his portrayal as a far-left, socialist-leaning progressive liberal. Known for championing controversial policies such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and a more open stance towards refugees, Obama used this platform to advocate for a strong global governance model underpinned by international law.

During his speech, Obama made a bold assertion about the need for the United States to prioritize international security, suggesting that this prioritization might necessitate a sacrifice of certain freedoms. He stressed the importance of cooperation with international organizations like the UN, arguing that a collaborative approach is crucial in today’s interconnected world.

While he asserted that the fundamental freedom citizens ought to preserve is the right to self-defense, his remarks stirred discontent among many Americans who feel disillusioned by his progressive policies. The criticism he faces highlights a deep divide within the nation, reflecting the broader political tensions in Washington D.C. 

The writer of this article expressed frustration over what they perceive as Obama's arrogance and his resistance to compromise, questioning the effectiveness of leadership that does not strive for a middle ground. This sentiment echoes a growing concern among citizens who are wary of a political landscape that lacks unity and collaborative dialogue.

As Obama's presidency comes to a close, his commitment to his beliefs remains unwavering, despite the backlash he faces from various factions. His vision for global governance and the prioritization of international law and cooperation continue to spark debate about the direction of American policy in a rapidly changing world.

For those interested in hearing Obama’s full address, a link has been provided, offering an insight into his enduring perspectives on global issues as he transitions from the presidency.",13.0,18.0,356.0,0.65,0.03651685393258427,348.0,1.6363636363636365,0.05172413793103448
Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

In the world of professional football, two prominent figures, Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick, find themselves in similar positions—both are not currently starting quarterbacks in the NFL. However, their public personas and approaches to social issues differ drastically, sparking conversations among fans and critics alike.

Tim Tebow, often regarded as a respected individual, has recently weighed in on Colin Kaepernick's protest during the National Anthem. Kaepernick's stance has drawn both support and criticism, with some viewing it as an important social statement and others branding it as disrespectful. Tebow's comments suggest he leans toward the latter viewpoint. He articulated the importance of standing for one’s beliefs but emphasized the necessity of doing so in what he considers the “right way.”

Kaepernick has faced extensive scrutiny for his actions on the field, particularly as a high-paid bench player, a status that Tebow believes undermines the gravity of his protest. According to Tebow, if Kaepernick wishes to express his dissent regarding social issues, he should do so during his personal time or through social media and public appearances, rather than on the football field. This comment reflects Tebow's belief in maintaining a distinction between one’s profession and personal convictions.

The discourse surrounding oppression in the United States has also played a central role in this conversation. Tebow theorizes that no one in the U.S. is truly oppressed, arguing instead that perceived oppression is an indication of laziness. He cited the presidency of Barack Obama as a testament to the notion that hard work can triumph over adversity and societal barriers. By invoking this example, Tebow suggests that individuals can rise above their circumstances through determination and effort.

Moreover, Tebow's perspective extends to criticism of Affirmative Action, which he argues has detrimental effects on those who find themselves disadvantaged by such policies. This stance aligns with his broader perspective that social programs, meant to address inequality, can inadvertently harm those they are intended to assist.

It's worth noting that Tebow's cautious approach may stem from his desire to avoid negative media attention while concentrating on his sporting career. His focus has recently shifted towards baseball, where he currently plays for the New York Mets. As he navigates this new venture, many fans have expressed hope for his success, both on the field and off.

In conclusion, the divergent paths of Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick continue to ignite discussions about belief, representation, and the role of athletes in social activism. While Tebow’s respectful demeanor garners appreciation from many, Kaepernick’s radical approach remains a topic of heated debate, underscoring the complexities of activism in professional sports. As both players move forward in their careers, their stances will undoubtedly influence public conversations for years to come.",-6.0,-7.0,472.0,-0.2222222222222222,-0.012711864406779662,532.0,-0.35,-0.013157894736842105
Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

As debates around immigration intensify, the border wall continues to be positioned as an essential national security measure aimed at curbing illegal immigration and addressing broader security threats. Historical examples, such as China’s Great Wall, highlight the long-standing practice of using fortifications to protect against foreign invasions, emphasizing that national security extends beyond mere immigration control.

The threat posed by drug cartels in Mexico is particularly alarming, with reports indicating that the death toll related to these criminal organizations is comparable to that of ISIS. This alarming statistic underscores the urgency for enhanced security along the U.S. southern border. Recent events have also raised significant concerns regarding potential exploitation of this unsecured border by terrorist organizations. The risk that ISIS may seek to infiltrate the U.S. through this vulnerable point has generated considerable anxiety among U.S. officials and citizens alike.

Adding to these fears, reports surfaced of eight Syrian nationals attempting to illegally cross into the United States from Mexico. This incident raised further security alarms in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, showcasing the potential for individuals linked to extremist groups to exploit weaknesses in border security. Although specific reports claim that these individuals were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas, official confirmation from Border Patrol has not been provided, leaving uncertainties about the accuracy of these accounts.

Hector Garza, president of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2455, has voiced concerns about the integrity of national security, stating that while there have been reports of Syrians attempting to cross the border, confirmation cannot be made due to security protocols. Garza also criticized the previous administration's limitations on Border Patrol’s operational effectiveness, arguing that such restrictions hinder the agency’s ability to secure the border adequately.

Moreover, Garza noted a troubling trend: a significant number of individuals apprehended crossing the border illegally are subsequently allowed to remain in the U.S., raising questions about the enforcement of immigration laws.

In light of these escalating concerns, there is an increasing call for stronger border security measures. This sentiment is echoed by various political figures, including a specific presidential candidate who is advocating for robust action to address national security and illegal immigration more effectively. As the public discourse continues, the importance of a fortified border remains at the forefront of the national security narrative.",-13.0,-22.0,420.0,-1.0,-0.030952380952380953,444.0,-1.4666666666666666,-0.04954954954954955

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

During a recent event, a group of Haitians in the audience shared their experiences regarding political figures, specifically highlighting their discontent with the Clinton family. Despite their eagerness to express their views, it was noted that media representatives did not stay long enough to hear the voices of those present.

As the event progressed, attendees voiced strong support for former President Donald Trump, cheering enthusiastically as he listened quietly to their concerns. Many speakers took the opportunity to air grievances regarding the Clintons, with particular emphasis on the lack of follow-up after donations made for Haitian aid.

Criticism of Hillary Clinton’s handling of aid funds was predominant, with attendees alleging that money intended for Haiti was misappropriated, suggesting that it ended up benefiting Washington lobbyists instead of reaching those in need. The audience also accused Hillary of obstructing a proposal aimed at raising Haiti's daily minimum wage from $3 to $5.

Interestingly, media coverage suggested an early exit by reporters when sentiments in the audience shifted against Hillary and grew more favorable towards Trump. This perceived avoidance raised eyebrows, as many speculated that the media left to escape reporting on the negative views directed at Hillary and the positive reception for Trump. 

The event highlighted significant frustrations within the Haitian community while reflecting a shift in political allegiances that resonated strongly throughout the gathering.",-2.0,2.0,278.0,-0.08695652173913043,-0.007194244604316547,262.0,0.2222222222222222,0.007633587786259542
Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

This issue traverses a complex landscape, as the article contends that the definition of racism involves a set of beliefs about racial superiority. By contrast, Islam is a religion, and such distinctions raise critical questions about the nature of prejudice and discrimination.

The widely held apprehensions about Islam often stem from its alleged connection to radicalization, particularly in light of numerous terrorist incidents that have been associated with individuals identifying as Muslim. Trump's proposal for a temporary ban is positioned as a safeguard against these threats, a preventative measure posed to protect national security. His stance reinforces existing fears that the integration of Muslim migrants could pose challenges to societal safety.

In Australia, sentiments reflecting those expressed by Trump have gained traction. A recent poll reveals a notable shift in public opinion, showing that 49% of Australians now support a ban on Muslim immigration. This marks a remarkable increase from just 28% in October of the previous year. The survey also uncovered that 48% of respondents are in favor of a national debate on the topic, demonstrating a growing willingness to engage with the contentious implications of such policies.

Echoing this, two-thirds of Australians align with the views of populist senator Pauline Hanson on issues commonly avoided by mainstream politicians. This alignment points to a burgeoning grassroots perspective that transcends traditional party lines, where political correctness and avoidance have often dominated. Supporters of the ban cite primary reasons rooted in fears over terrorism and the belief that Muslim migrants may not assimilate into Australian cultural values.

The demographics of the poll indicate that the support for banning Muslim immigration is not limited to a singular political segment; 60% of right-wing Coalition voters, 40% of Labour voters, and 34% of Green voters endorse the cessation of Muslim migration. The pollster's surprise at the widespread acceptance of these views highlights that such sentiments cannot simply be dismissed as fringe opinions, but rather, reflect a significant portion of the electorate. This broad appeal presents challenges for politicians who may underestimate the depth of public concern over the implications of Muslim immigration.

Furthermore, the conversation around this issue invites scrutiny of the language used to describe its supporters. The suggestion to recognize this substantial voter base is juxtaposed against derogatory labels often leveraged by detractors, such as ""deplorables."" These terms serve to belittle legitimate concerns and potential grievances that members of the public may hold, ultimately hindering constructive dialogue.

As Australia grapples with the complexities of immigration policy and national security, the proposals advocating for a ban on Muslim immigration have catalyzed a pivotal discourse. It remains to be seen how political leaders will navigate these issues while being responsive to the evolving sentiments of their constituents. The implications of this discussion should not be underestimated, as they may shape future policies and national attitudes toward immigration and cultural integration. As the landscape continues to evolve, the urgency for an inclusive, yet critical examination of these perspectives becomes increasingly apparent.",2.0,-7.0,580.0,0.08,0.0034482758620689655,590.0,-0.30434782608695654,-0.011864406779661017

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on

In a troubling series of events, a recent incident on a busy roadway has drawn attention to the increasingly violent nature of public altercations and the response—or lack thereof—from bystanders. The event began as a physical altercation among participants but escalated horrifically when individuals involved were unexpectedly set on fire, leaving witnesses in shock at the disturbing scene.

The incident, initially reported by a news outlet, faced scrutiny when Buzzfeed labeled the preliminary description of the crime and its victims as false. This led the author of the original account to issue a rebuttal, defending the accuracy of the observations made during the chaotic situation. The rebuttal highlights the complexity of documenting such incidents in real-time, especially when emotions and perceptions may cloud judgment.

The author reflects deeply on the violent act, specifically questioning the mindset that prompts individuals to resort to extreme measures, including the use of a Molotov cocktail. The act of using such a destructive tool not only signifies a departure from rationality but also evokes a broader discussion about the normalization of violence in society today.

Adding to the alarm is the apparent apathy displayed by bystanders during the incident. The author contrasts current social behaviors with those of the past, criticizing a troubling trend where individuals stand idly by while violent altercations unfold. This shift raises significant concerns over community responsibility and the role of citizens in ensuring the safety and well-being of one another.

Compounding this issue is the unsettling prioritization of capturing viral videos over human safety and decency. The lens of social media has transformed many into passive observers, more eager to document the chaos for online platforms than to intervene and help those in distress. This troubling behavior signals a deterioration of community values, wherein the immediate appeal of online notoriety takes precedence over the moral imperative to assist others.

As society grapples with these issues, it becomes increasingly imperative to encourage active participation in ensuring public safety. The expectation for bystanders to act decisively and compassionately during moments of turmoil cannot be understated. Without a concerted effort to reclaim a sense of responsibility for one another, communities risk normalizing violence and indifference, creating an environment where such chaotic incidents become alarming yet routine occurrences.

This recent incident serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for change in both social norms and individual mindsets as the community collectively navigates the troubling landscape of public safety and personal accountability.",-5.0,-46.0,444.0,-0.17857142857142858,-0.01126126126126126,455.0,-2.7058823529411766,-0.1010989010989011
Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{},"- The need for a border wall is emphasized, not just for illegal immigration but for national security.

In a recent incident that has reignited the debate over national security and border enforcement, police in Luna County, New Mexico, initiated heightened alert after the apprehension of an undocumented woman reportedly carrying plans for a gas pipeline. This woman, described in reports as an ""Islamic refugee,"" raised suspicions due to her unclear motives surrounding the possession of such sensitive information, prompting an investigation by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and U.S. Border Patrol.

While authorities found no immediate threat associated with the woman, the implications of her presence and the nature of the plans have fueled concerns regarding border security. The pipeline referenced in her documents is situated in a remote area, leading to speculation about potential future attacks on critical infrastructure. This incident has particularly intensified fears over undocumented individuals crossing from Mexico, especially if linked to groups associated with terrorism.

The troubling links between criminal organizations and terrorist groups have been underscored by prior reports. A 2015 study by Judicial Watch highlighted established ties between Mexican cartels and various terrorism factions. Moreover, a 2017 disclosure indicated that Islamic terror groups have crossed the southwestern border to scout targets within the United States, raising alarms about the vulnerability of the southern border.

This latest event further exemplifies the arguments made by proponents of stricter border security measures, notably the construction of a border wall as advocated by President Trump. Supporters cite the urgent need for Congress to allocate funding for the wall, emphasizing that its implementation could help prevent the entry of both terrorists and drug cartels who allegedly receive backing from segments of the Mexican government.

The discussion surrounding a border wall has been framed not only in the context of illegal immigration but fundamentally as a critical measure for protecting national security. Advocates argue that if terrorists can easily navigate the southern border, the potential for unchecked entry creates severe risks for the nation. With many illegal immigrants arriving in the U.S. from countries south of Mexico, the emphasis on securing the border has never felt more pressing.

As the situation continues to develop, the necessity of a fortified border is increasingly seen as essential to safeguard the nation from foreign threats. The intersection of immigration policy and national security has become a focal point for both policymakers and citizens alike, as the implications of current border dynamics remain a significant concern for the future of U.S. security.",-44.0,-27.0,443.0,-1.9130434782608696,-0.09932279909706546,451.0,-1.8,-0.0598669623059867
Fake_53-Webpage,CNN’s Post-Debate Rigged Poll Busted…Here Are The Real Results,"We’re shocked — SHOCKED — to learn that CNN’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

…and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",http://freedomdaily.com/nfl-told-russell-wilson-not-speak-faith-something-fans-couldnt-believe/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/0059768001463454026_filepicker.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Russell Wilson, the talented quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, has always been a man deeply rooted in his faith. In recent statements, he emphasized how this love for God drives his desire to make a positive impact on the lives of others. Wilson is not just focused on the football field; he aims to change lives and leave a lasting legacy marked by true joy that comes from selfless service.

While Wilson is undeniably committed to winning games and achieving victory in his sport, he makes it clear that his priorities extend beyond football. Off the field, his faith, family, and friends occupy the top slots on his list of what matters most. This holistic approach to life allows him to maintain balance amid the pressures of the NFL, a league often criticized for its demanding and high-stakes environment.

He understands and accepts the NFL's directive which discourages its players from discussing their faith openly during interviews. Instead of speaking about his beliefs, Wilson prefers to express them through his actions, showcasing how faith can translate into a commitment to bettering the lives of others. He believes that when one keeps faith as a priority, it not only cultivates a fulfilling life but also leads to positive outcomes, significantly reducing stress in the chaos of a professional sports career.

Wilson has also voiced his concerns about the perils that accompany success, especially as they relate to influential figures within society. He critiques those who, having achieved fame and success, lose sight of the values that once defined them. “When people achieve success, they sometimes let go of their foundational beliefs,” he remarked, highlighting a prevalent issue that resonates not just within the sports world but throughout leadership in various domains.

The quarterback does not shy away from discussing broader societal concerns either. He speaks out against the dangers of corruption and deception that plague leadership roles. In a world where transparency and integrity seem less prioritized, Wilson urges those in power to remain accountable and ethical. His advocacy serves as a reminder that the principles of honesty and sincerity should guide not only athletic athletes but also all leaders, from corporate executives to political figures.

Furthermore, Wilson takes a bold stance on the perceived hypocrisy surrounding societal attitudes towards faith and patriotism. He questions why expressing one's belief system and showing respect for one’s country is often met with skepticism. “Why is it that serving others and promoting happiness is viewed negatively?” he queried, pointing to a trend that he believes indicates a deeper issue within modern societal values.

The Seahawks quarterback suggests that with the rapid pace of contemporary life, many have begun to overlook fundamental truths that once formed the bedrock of community and personal interaction. In a climate where vital discussions on faith and service seem discouraged or misinterpreted, Wilson advocates for a return to these essential narratives. He believes that prioritizing values like joy, service, and love for God can profoundly alter perceptions and foster an atmosphere of unity and support.

In an age where achievements can often overshadow ethics, Russell Wilson stands firm in his commitment to both his sport and his faith. He remains a beacon for those who seek to find balance in their lives while striving to uplift others around them. Through his actions and platform, Wilson reiterates the importance of remembering one’s core principles, advocating for a legacy that transcends football and touches the very essence of humanity. As he continues his career, his message resonates with many—emphasizing that true victory lies in both faith and service.",79.0,64.0,596.0,2.7241379310344827,0.1325503355704698,678.0,2.4615384615384617,0.0943952802359882
Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

Pope Francis has called attention to the alarming influence of fear-based media in today's society, likening it to a form of ""terrorism"" that undermines the fabric of individual lives and communities. His remarks were particularly aimed at the Italian press but carry significant implications for a wider audience, particularly criticizing channels such as Fox News for their role in perpetuating fear among viewers.

In a powerful statement, the Pope criticized journalism driven by gossip and rumors, emphasizing its potential to inflict harm not only on individuals but also on society at large. He underscored the ethical responsibilities of the media, arguing that they must prioritize truth and integrity over sensationalism that fuels public anxiety.

Referencing the iconic words of former President Franklin D. Roosevelt—“we have nothing to fear but fear itself”—the Pope articulated a profound concern about the destructiveness of fear propagated by media outlets. He pointed out that despite the significant decline in actual crime rates in recent years, public fear in the United States has surged to unprecedented levels, with growing apprehensions surrounding terrorism and criminal activity. Polls reveal that Americans are now more worried about being victims of terror or violent crime than they have been in over a decade.

The source of this pervasive fear can largely be traced to the media's representation of crime and violence. Incidents of mass shootings and violent protests, though statistically less frequent, have contributed to a widespread sense of disorder in society. The Pope's critique highlights the dangerous disconnect between reality and perception, where declining crime rates do not alleviate public anxiety but, instead, seem to exacerbate it.

Fox News has emerged as a focal point in this discourse, identified as a significant purveyor of fear for its viewers. The network’s relentless focus on sensational stories has influenced public perceptions and, in turn, political outcomes, notably affecting support for figures like former President Donald Trump. The algebra of fear, as portrayed by certain media channels, can reverberate through the political landscape, breeding division and transforming public discourse.

Pope Francis’s condemnation of fear-based journalism resonates not only within Italy but also across the globe. As media continues to shape societal norms and beliefs, the implications of fear-driven narratives reveal the urgent need for responsible reporting. The Pope's remarks serve as a call to action for journalists and media outlets to reflect on their impact and to strive for a more balanced, truthful portrayal of the world, thus fostering a healthier public dialogue that combats the cycles of fear and misinformation.",-56.0,-73.0,454.0,-2.6666666666666665,-0.12334801762114538,485.0,-4.5625,-0.15051546391752577
Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

The first general election debate of the season revealed a polarized audience, with various polling sources declaring differing winners in a night defined by contentious topics. CNN's assessment indicated Hillary Clinton emerged victorious, with a snap poll showing her at 62% support among viewers, compared to Donald Trump's 27%. This significant gap, however, raised questions about the validity of the results, as the CNN poll was reportedly composed of a sample that leaned more Democrat.

In contrast, snap polls from other outlets, including TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville, painted a different picture, with many declaring Trump the debate night victor. The disparity in polling outcomes has sparked discussions about the influence of methodology in measuring public perception following such high-stakes exchanges.

Among the major topics tackled during the debate were the controversial Birther movement, which Trump has previously championed, Clinton's email controversies, and the scrutiny over Trump’s tax returns. These themes are expected to play crucial roles in shaping voters' decisions as the election approaches.

Post-debate reactions have illustrated the tension between the candidates. Trump took to Twitter to express gratitude to his supporters for their belief in his victory. Clinton has yet to issue a response or acknowledgment of the debate's outcome, leaving space for speculation about her strategy moving forward.

Trump also expressed dissatisfaction with the debate conditions, claiming issues with his microphone impeded his performance. He notably suggested he should have confronted Clinton about former President Bill Clinton's infidelities, emphasizing the high stakes and emotions at play. Furthermore, Trump hinted at the possibility of skipping future debates, despite asserting his dominance in the current exchange.

As the election draws nearer, both candidates are running out of time to sway undecided voters. Compounding the suspense, Julian Assange has teased an impending leak from Wikileaks that could further complicate Clinton’s campaign. With every debate and revelation, the race continues to tighten, underscoring the urgency felt by both parties in this pivotal moment of American democracy.",18.0,-4.0,384.0,0.782608695652174,0.046875,404.0,-0.25,-0.009900990099009901

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

In the aftermath of a high-profile debate, post-debate polls suggest that Hillary Clinton emerged victorious over Donald Trump, as indicated by focus groups conducted by both Fox News and CNN. 

CNN's focus group results showcased a significant lead for Clinton, reflecting an 18-2 victory among participants from Florida. Similarly, a separate focus group by Fox News reported a 16-6 win for Clinton, with its participants hailing from Pennsylvania. The overwhelming support for Clinton in these focus groups highlights her successful engagement during critical moments of the debate.

Pollster Frank Luntz analyzed Trump’s performance, noting that the former President’s standing declined notably when questioned about his taxes. However, he pointed out that Trump’s standing improved when the discussion shifted to Clinton's email controversy, suggesting that while Trump struggled with certain topics, he found traction on others. Additionally, Trump faced difficulties addressing questions surrounding Barack Obama's birthplace, an issue that has lingered in American politics.

Despite the strong focus group results for Clinton, another poll surfaced showing a strikingly different perspective, revealing Trump with a commanding 92% to 8% lead. This discrepancy raises questions about the varied interpretations of debate performances and partisan divides among voters.

Following her perceived victory, Clinton took to Twitter to celebrate her success, a move that sparked backlash on social media. The hashtag #TrumpWon quickly gained traction, with critics expressing their disapproval of Clinton’s celebratory tone. Moreover, some detractors accused her of sidestepping media scrutiny post-debate, a claim that may overshadow her focus group successes.

As the debate fallout continues to be analyzed, the contrasting results from different polls and social media reactions reflect the polarized nature of American politics. Clinton's victory in focus groups presents a compelling narrative, yet the broader public perception remains divided, underscoring the complexities of voter sentiment in an election year.",18.0,20.0,364.0,0.9,0.04945054945054945,364.0,1.4285714285714286,0.054945054945054944
Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Charlotte, NC – Protests erupted in Charlotte for the second consecutive night on Monday as citizens expressed their outrage over the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. The anger of the community reached new heights as a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured during the demonstrations, leading to chaos and confusion regarding the circumstances surrounding the shooting.

What began as a peaceful gathering of approximately 1,000 protesters, equipped with signs and heartfelt chants advocating for justice, quickly spiraled into turmoil after the arrival of riot police. Eyewitness accounts and conflicting reports regarding the shooting highlighted a troubling narrative of state violence and raised serious questions about the conduct of law enforcement during the protests.

Initial reports indicated that the civilian who was shot had been struck in the head and sustained critical injuries. Law enforcement asserted that the shooter was another civilian. However, numerous eyewitnesses quickly contested this claim, insisting that police fired the shot that led to the serious injury.

Among the witnesses was Todd Zimmer, who delivered a graphic description of the scene and shared a photo capturing the tense moment. “My city is lying about what happened tonight,” he declared, calling into question the narrative presented by the authorities.

Kahran Meyer, a defense lawyer and also an eyewitness to the incident, reinforced Zimmer's sentiment by unequivocally stating, “I heard a gunshot that was NOT by a civilian.” Meyer characterized the protest as peaceful until the police arrived, emphasizing the stark shift in atmosphere once law enforcement took their position.

As the disturbances unfolded, witnesses recounted hearing a gunshot noise that, according to several accounts, was too loud to be produced by a standard firearm. This detail has led many to doubt the police’s assertion about the nature of the shooting and who was responsible. 

The City of Charlotte, in an attempt to manage the narrative regarding the shooting incident, quickly positioned itself to assert that the injury to the civilian was a result of civilian gunfire. This swift move to control the story contrasted sharply with the trending perspective among protestors and witnesses, who felt that accountability lay with police actions.

Amidst the rising tensions, Minister Steve Knight emerged as a vocal figure, connecting the dots between the shooting and police involvement. Alongside other eyewitnesses, he attributed the violence directly to actions taken by law enforcement during the protest. Their accounts depicted a grim pattern of state responses to demonstrations, particularly those originating from the African-American community.

The backdrop of these protests—the killing of Kenneth L. Scott—has added further fuel to the fire of civil unrest in Charlotte. Scott’s death has become emblematic of ongoing issues pertaining to police violence and systemic injustice within the community. The protests, initially grounded in mourning and demands for justice, have now taken on a tone of assertive defiance against what participants perceive as recollections of state-sanctioned brutality.

As turmoil erupted, Charlotte became a focal point for discussions surrounding the use of force by law enforcement, particularly in the context of protests aimed at voicing grievances against systemic racism and police brutality. Many demonstrators have become increasingly aware of the historical patterns of violence and suppression that often follow peaceful assemblies, particularly when they seek to draw attention to the inequities faced by marginalized groups.

Reflecting on the events, Todd Zimmer's assertion that the police were not truthful about the shooting underscores a growing mistrust in the local law enforcement community. This sentiment is not unique to Charlotte but resonates deeply throughout America, where countless citizens have taken to the streets in recent years to protest against police violence and advocate for reform.

As news of the civilian's critical condition spread through Charlotte, it became evident that the protests were no longer confined to calls for justice for Kenneth L. Scott. Instead, they evolved into a broader condemnation of policing practices and a demand for accountability amidst mounting frustrations over systemic issues. 

The arrival of riot police prompted demonstrators who had initially gathered in a spirit of solidarity and peace to respond with outrage. Eyewitness Kahran Meyer described how the peaceful nature of the gathering shifted dramatically, showcasing the stark divide that often emerges when citizen-led protests intersect with tactical law enforcement responses.

Many attending the protests held steadfast to the belief that their voices should not be met with intimidation and violence. Instead, they argued that their actions were part of a necessary dialogue about justice—a message ironically juxtaposed against the backdrop of the very violence they seek to eradicate.

As the situation in Charlotte continues to develop, the community's call for justice remains unwavering, fueled by the stark realities of the events that have unfolded. The citizenry, backed by the testimonies of eyewitnesses, seeks not only accountability for individuals involved in the shooting but also broader reform aiming to address systemic issues within law enforcement.

While the rallying cries for justice echo through the streets of Charlotte, the city confronts a pivotal moment in its history as it grapples with the painful truths of racial injustice and police violence. Protesters, bolstered by their commitment to effecting change, are hopeful for a brighter future, one where equity and justice prevail over violence and oppression.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of these protests and the troubling events surrounding them, it remains crucial for the community and local authorities to engage in open dialogue. Only through transparency, accountability, and a recognition of the systemic problems can trust be rebuilt and healing begin. 

Amidst the tumult of anger and grief, many in the community clamor for resolution—not only in seeking justice for Kenneth L. Scott but in addressing the larger issues of violence, inequality, and the systemic barriers that have long plagued the city and the nation at large. As the sentences of protest evolve into cries for change, one thing is clear: the residents of Charlotte are determined to be heard.",-74.0,-90.0,1156.0,-1.7209302325581395,-0.06401384083044982,1098.0,-2.3684210526315788,-0.08196721311475409
Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

In the wake of several alarming revelations, former President Donald Trump’s foreign policy has come under increasing scrutiny due to his perceived support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Critics point to a troubling web of connections linking Trump to individuals closely tied to the Kremlin and Russian oligarchs, raising significant questions about his potential administration’s priorities regarding international relations and national security.

Despite Trump’s repeated assertions that he has “ZERO investments in Russia,” investigations are surfacing that contradict this claim. An examination by ABC News has discovered evidence of “numerous ties” between Trump and Russian interests, comprising hundreds of millions of dollars in business activities. This contradictory narrative complicates Trump’s positioning as a candidate, making it vital for constituents to understand the implications of these findings.

The implications of these ties extend beyond mere rhetoric. Russian state-controlled media and intelligence services reportedly have backed Trump throughout his political ascent. This support has raised alarms about potential foreign influence on U.S. political affairs. Additionally, there are accusations that Russian operatives breached Democratic Party servers, which many see as part of a broader strategy to destabilize American democracy.

Moreover, Trump’s reliance on Russian oligarchs has led to significant business profits, particularly during key events such as the 2013 Miss Universe contest and various real estate transactions. Certain areas in Florida have even been dubbed “Little Moscow” due to the prominent presence and influence of Russian financial interests in the region. The wealth amassed by these oligarchs, who capitalized on the privatization of state-owned companies during Russia's shift to a free-market economy, further indicates the depth of Trump’s financial entanglements.

These oligarchs have used their substantial wealth not only to enrich themselves but also to bolster Putin’s regime. Observers express concern that Trump's potential presidency could create severe conflicts of interest, especially regarding existing U.S. sanctions imposed on Russian elites following Crimea's annexation in 2014. These sanctions were designed to undermine the financial power of oligarchs who had supported the Kremlin but could be at risk if Trump's financial entanglements with these individuals remain unresolved.

Critics are raising weighty questions: As the looming possibility of a second Trump presidency intensifies, can he prioritize national interests, or will personal financial gain take precedence in his decision-making? With Trump properties serving as favored channels for Russian oligarchs looking to launder money, the implications of these connections are troubling. Further complicating this issue is testimony from former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who described Russian oligarchs as being not only materialistic but also culturally ignorant, characteristics that could bear serious consequences in international diplomacy.

In light of these revelations, calls for congressional action are surfacing as lawmakers grapple with the ramifications of potential foreign entanglements within Trump’s circle. Some advocates argue that the growing evidence supports serious considerations for impeachment based on the allegations of conflicting interests relating to Russian oligarchs and Trump's foreign policy.

The contours of this situation are gravely serious and merit vigilant oversight. As national security concerns mount, it becomes increasingly clear that Trump's past and potential future relationships with Russian interests could undermine the integrity of American policy-making. Lawmakers, analysts, and the American public must take heed of these issues, fostering a dialogue on how best to preserve the nation’s interests amidst growing foreign entanglements.

In conclusion, the intersection of Trump’s foreign policy stance and his financial connections with Russia creates a complex and volatile situation that demands transparent scrutiny. With the eyes of an anxious nation watching, leaders must navigate these revelations carefully, ensuring that any potential leadership does not compromise the nation’s commitment to securing its sovereignty and protecting its democratic foundation. The narrative surrounding Trump's ties to Russia invites further investigation and a critical discourse on the implications for American governance moving forward.",27.0,13.0,786.0,0.9310344827586207,0.03435114503816794,730.0,0.5,0.01780821917808219
Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is confronting a potential impeachment as state legislators delve into his alleged involvement in the controversial George Washington Bridge closure, an action purportedly designed to retaliate against a political rival. The investigation into this incident, which has become infamously known as ""Bridgegate,"" has raised serious questions regarding Christie's accountability and integrity as a public official.

As part of the ongoing investigation, a judge has mandated that Christie produce personal emails connected to the Bridgegate scandal. This directive is a crucial step in unraveling the full extent of Christie's involvement and could significantly impact the legal and political repercussions he faces moving forward.

The responsibility to advance the impeachment discussion lies with Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto. Should Prieto decide to move forward with the impeachment, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would be tasked with initiating the process, setting the stage for a potentially historic confrontation within New Jersey's political landscape.

For an impeachment to be successful, it will require a majority vote from the 80-member Assembly. If the Assembly were to vote in favor of impeachment, the case would then proceed to a trial in the Senate. At that stage, a two-thirds majority of senators would be necessary for a conviction, underscoring the significance of bipartisan support in what is sure to be a contentious political battle.

Christie's political woes extend beyond the Bridgegate scandal itself. During a recent federal trial involving his senior aides, prosecutors implicated Christie in orchestrating the traffic shutdown that led to severe consequences, including a delay in an ambulance that resulted in a death. Such revelations complicate his position significantly, painting a troubling picture of his leadership during an incident that critically affected emergency services.

Adding to the complexity of the situation is Christie's role as the chair of Donald Trump’s transition team. This association has been viewed by many as a stark deviation from Christie's earlier political aspirations, particularly given his flirtation with a presidential run. Christie's endorsement of Trump was seen as a pivotal moment in his career, yet many now regard this endorsement in light of his ongoing scandals as indicative of a larger fall from grace.

In the aftermath of the Bridgegate incident, Christie's credibility has been under intense scrutiny. Back in January 2014, during a nationally televised press conference, he emphatically denied any knowledge of the scandal. However, recent disclosures suggest that Christie was briefed about the traffic situation during a memorial ceremony for 9/11 victims in 2013, yet he failed to take any decisive action. This contradiction has fueled further accusations against him, particularly accusations of lying to the public and officials alike about his involvement.

As public sentiment shifts and calls for his removal intensify, Christie may find himself at a crossroads that could determine not only his political future but also set a significant precedent for accountability in public office.

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

In a dramatic moment during the Republican primary debate in September 2015, Donald Trump made a bold claim regarding his influence with Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor. Trump asserted that he had never lobbied Bush to advance his interests in casino gambling within the state. This statement was part of a larger narrative where Trump implied that, had he sought such an initiative, Bush would have readily granted it, suggesting a level of influence that raises eyebrows in the political arena.

Yet, the implications of Trump’s assertion have come under intense scrutiny. Legal experts and analysts have raised allegations that this statement may amount to perjury if it contradicts previous testimony he provided during a civil court deposition in 2007. The crux of the matter hinges on the notion that if Trump was actively lobbying for changes in gambling legislation, his denials during the debate could constitute a falsehood made under oath, leading to serious legal consequences.

Investigative journalist Kurt Eichenwald has weighed in on the situation, suggesting a troubling dichotomy: either Trump lied on national television during the debate, or he committed perjury when testifying in court regarding his efforts to influence gambling laws in Florida. This analysis points to a deeper concern about the integrity and consistency of Trump’s statements, particularly as they relate to significant political and legislative issues.

In response to Trump’s claims during the debate, Jeb Bush countered with a pointed retort, stating that Donald Trump had indeed sought to change his anti-gambling position, further asserting that Trump had offered financial support to him in the past. Bush's counterstatement only served to amplify the controversy surrounding Trump’s assertions, showcasing a direct contradiction to Trump’s claim of maintaining distance from lobbying efforts.

The 2007 deposition paints a different picture of Trump’s interactions with Bush, revealing that he had indeed engaged with the former governor in an attempt to gain support for his casino ventures. This critical inconsistency in Trump’s narrative raises questions about his credibility and the potential impacts of such contradictions on his public persona and political ambitions.

The stakes of these discrepancies are underscored when we recall historical precedent in American politics. The impeachment of President Bill Clinton serves as a sobering reminder of the gravity attached to the act of lying under oath. Clinton faced significant backlash and ultimately impeachment due, in large part, to his dishonesty in a deposition regarding personal matters. The echo of this event reverberates in the current discourse surrounding Trump, as the importance of integrity and truthfulness in leadership continues to be a vital concern for voters and political analysts alike.

Trump’s history of providing inconsistent accounts and making broad statements verging on untruths has become a major focal point in discussions about his candidacy. Critics argue that such dishonesty poses grave implications, not just for Trump's personal credibility, but for the national safety and stability of the country. The various facets of the allegations against him lead to calls for serious repercussions, with some voices in the political landscape advocating for impeachment based on his fabrications.

The culture of truthfulness in political discourse is undergoing significant strain, and the implications of Trump’s statements extend beyond the realm of personal ethics. The measures taken—or not taken—against him may set a precedent for future conduct within political office, shaping public perceptions around accountability and leadership in a way that resonates deeply with the electorate.

As this controversy unfolds, the demand for action grows louder. Calls for impeachment echo from various factions within the political sphere, highlighting a growing anxiety that continued dishonesty at such high levels of government may jeopardize not only the integrity of the political system but also the safety and wellbeing of the nation. 

While the investigation into Trump's statements continues to develop, the conversation surrounding truth, influence, and accountability remains pivotal. The contradictions between his televised assertions and his past testimonies suggest a pressing need for clarity. With the spotlight on these inconsistencies, the question remains—how will they affect Trump's standing among voters, and what repercussions might follow in the broader political landscape?

In a nation where the implications of words and actions ripple wide and deep, the ongoing dialogue about Trump's alleged deception serves as a critical examination of not only his character but also the standards to which leaders are held. As voters and constituents grapple with the realities of political representation, the necessity for honesty in leadership is more pressing than ever. 

The unfolding narrative surrounding Trump’s claims offers a critical case study into the intersection of media, politics, and truth—a narrative that epitomizes the complexities of contemporary governance and public perception. As the nation watches closely, the unresolved tension between Trump’s claims and his past actions may ultimately play a defining role in shaping the future of political discourse and accountability in America. 

In conclusion, the controversy stemming from Trump’s statements during the debate has opened a crucial dialogue about integrity in leadership, the potential consequences of misrepresentation, and the essential need for accountability among those who seek to govern. As investigations continue and the public discourse evolves, one thing remains clear: the impact of truth, or the lack thereof, cannot be underestimated in the fabric of democratic governance.",-29.0,-18.0,1058.0,-0.7073170731707317,-0.027410207939508508,990.0,-0.5625,-0.01818181818181818
Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{},"- Many viewers participated in a commercial-free debate on CNN, turning it into a drinking game.
- The US Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned that drinking each time Donald Trump lies could lead to alcohol poisoning.

Amid a unique commercial-free debate format on CNN, many viewers have turned the political showdown into a drinking game, prompting health warnings from the US Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy. The gimmick of consuming alcohol each time former President Donald Trump is perceived to deceive has raised concerns about the risky behavior associated with such practices.

Murthy specifically cautioned that indulging in this game could lead to alcohol poisoning, given the frequency of Trump’s disinformation. In reference to previous debates, Murthy noted the potential hazards that drinking games present, particularly in light of the current Republican field, which has drawn significant public attention. Looking back to the 2012 debate season, it was reported that approximately 70,000 incidents of alcohol poisoning occurred as a result of similar activities, prompting calls for caution from public health officials.

As the debate dates approach, the Surgeon General reiterated his concerns originating from the past presidential face-offs, notably before the highly publicized first debate between Hillary Clinton and Trump on September 26, 2016. This prior experience underscored the risky nature of drinking games within the context of political discourse, especially when Trump’s tendency to mislead had been highlighted.

A recent study conducted by Politico shed light on Trump’s track record of falsehoods, revealing that from September 15 to 20, he made 87 false statements, averaging one lie every three minutes and 15 seconds. If this pattern holds true, it suggests that Trump could potentially tell about 28 lies throughout an evening's debate. Such numbers intensify the potential dangers of a drinking game predicated on false statements.

In light of these findings, Surgeon General Murthy has urged Americans to engage in debates responsibly, reminding viewers of the potential for alcohol-related emergencies. He advised participants in the drinking game to consider “baby sips” instead of larger quantities of alcohol when met with Trump’s fabrications during the upcoming debates leading up to the November 8 election.

As debate season heats up, the intersection of political engagement and personal health continues to emerge as a critical topic, urging voters to stay informed while prioritizing their well-being.",-17.0,-8.0,407.0,-1.1333333333333333,-0.04176904176904177,404.0,-0.6153846153846154,-0.019801980198019802
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

In the wake of the recent debate, mainstream media outlets have largely declared Hillary Clinton the winner. However, this positive assessment stands in stark contrast to the prevailing sentiment expressed across online platforms. Notably, polls conducted on social media and trends on Twitter suggested a different narrative, with the hashtag #TrumpWon climbing to the top of the trending topics in the United States.

Interestingly, the #TrumpWon hashtag appears to have originated from St. Petersburg, Russia. This raises concerns about the potential for foreign influence in shaping public opinion during a pivotal electoral moment. The Russian regime, led by President Vladimir Putin, has a well-documented history of using cyber-trolls to promote its interests and disseminate disinformation, particularly in the context of American political discourse. By flooding social media with pro-Trump propaganda, these operatives may be attempting to sway public sentiment and alter electoral outcomes.

Putin's motivations are strategically aligned with his desire to manipulate U.S. foreign policy. Analysts suggest that influencing an American president like Donald Trump could pave the way for the lifting of sanctions imposed against Russian oligarchs and allow for a more unencumbered approach to Russian actions in Eastern Europe, where aggression has increasingly raised alarm among neighboring countries and global powers.

Reports from former bloggers and social media operatives in Russia reveal the grim working conditions within this digital landscape. They compare their experiences to an “internet sweat shop,” highlighting the rigorous demands placed on individuals who are tasked with promoting disinformation and politically charged narratives online.

With the debate's aftermath igniting a public debate about the reliability of online polls, experts provide a crucial warning: users should be cautious in trusting results emerging from social media, as this information can be easily manipulated by foreign entities seeking to destabilize American democracy. Engaging with these potentially foreign troll accounts could further complicate public discourse and propagate misleading narratives.

Adding to the complexity of the entire situation, a bipartisan call to action is emerging from within Congress. Lawmakers are urging a comprehensive investigation into the alleged crimes committed by Donald Trump during his time in office. This represents a concerted effort to promote accountability and may hint at a broader discussion regarding the impeachment process. As the nation grapples with these contentious issues, the lines between genuine public sentiment and foreign interference continue to blur, raising new questions about the integrity of the political landscape.",-9.0,-4.0,422.0,-0.75,-0.02132701421800948,453.0,-0.23529411764705882,-0.008830022075055188
Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Palantir Technologies, the data analytics firm co-founded by billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, is facing a significant legal challenge as the U.S. Department of Labor has filed a federal lawsuit alleging systematic employment discrimination against Asian job applicants. The lawsuit points to troubling patterns in the company’s hiring processes, particularly concerning engineering intern positions for which a majority of applicants were Asian.

According to the complaint, a staggering 73% of the 130 applicants who sought internships in engineering at Palantir identified as Asian. However, the hiring outcomes reflect a stark discrepancy: only four Asian candidates were selected for positions, in contrast to 17 non-Asian applicants who were hired. This significant imbalance has raised concerns about potential bias within the hiring practices at Palantir, leading to the accusation of discriminatory behavior.

The lawsuit has cast a spotlight not only on Palantir's recruitment methods but also on Thiel's complex political identity. Known for his influential role in Silicon Valley and for being an early backer of successful ventures such as PayPal and Facebook, Thiel’s recent actions have been scrutinized for apparent hypocrisy. As a first-generation immigrant himself, he has publicly supported political figures, including Donald Trump, who are known for advocating strict immigration policies. This contradiction has stirred debate, particularly as Thiel, an openly gay speaker at the Republican National Convention, expressed pride in his identity and political stance amidst an anti-LGBT platform adopted by the GOP.

The Department of Labor has emphasized that federal contractors like Palantir are obligated to provide equal employment opportunities to all applicants, regardless of their background. This legal framework underscores the gravity of the allegations against Palantir and highlights the accountability that comes with such federal contracts. 

In response to the lawsuit, Palantir has expressed its intention to vigorously defend itself against the claims of discrimination. The company is expected to outline its hiring practices and demonstrate how they align with the legal standards set for equitable employment. As the case unfolds, Thiel’s leadership at the company will be under scrutiny, particularly as he is tasked with ensuring that Palantir's hiring methods are both compliant and free from bias.

The current legal challenges add a layer of complexity to Thiel's public persona, especially given his previous high-profile involvement in legal battles, including his funding of Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker earlier this year. This history of using financial resources to influence legal outcomes places additional pressure on Thiel as he navigates this latest lawsuit.

As the case progresses, industry observers remain keenly interested in how the allegations will be resolved and what impact they may have on the broader discourse around diversity and inclusion within tech companies. Critics argue that discrimination, especially in high-demand fields like engineering, not only undermines individual opportunity but also stifles innovation by limiting the perspectives brought to the table.

The employment discrimination lawsuit against Palantir serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges in achieving equitable hiring practices within the tech industry. With the company at the intersection of technology, politics, and culture, the repercussions of the lawsuit could extend well beyond its immediate legal implications. As Palantir prepares its defense, the case is likely to draw further attention to the need for systemic change in recruitment practices—an issue that resonates with many sectors facing similar critiques.

In conclusion, Palantir Technologies finds itself in the midst of a legal storm that probes into the heart of its hiring practices. The outcome of the lawsuit will have significant implications not only for the company but also for the tech industry's broader engagement with issues of discrimination and diversity, as well as Peter Thiel’s multifaceted identity in both business and politics. As the Department of Labor takes a firm stance on equal employment opportunities, Palantir’s case may serve as a catalyst for change within a field that has long grappled with the challenges of inclusivity.",-18.0,-6.0,657.0,-0.8571428571428571,-0.0273972602739726,725.0,-0.25,-0.008275862068965517

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

Buy Now You probably have all seen the news by now, the explosives detonated in New York City, that was me. Those were just some tests, I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time. I did it because I cannot stand society. I cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society. It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late.

In a chilling turn of events following the Chelsea bombing incident, authorities have uncovered a hand-written letter featuring Arabic text found within a plastic bag that contained a second bomb. This discovery has raised additional alarm bells and prompted further investigations into the motivations behind the recent attacks in New York City.

The string of incidents began with an explosion that rocked the Chelsea neighborhood, injuring 29 individuals. Fortunately, all victims have since been discharged from the hospital, but the atmosphere remains tense as officials assess the implications of the ongoing investigation. In light of the chaos, a 911 call from an unidentified male has added urgency to the situation, warning listeners of impending explosions and stating ominously, “There will be more.” The chilling nature of this communication has left both authorities and the public on edge.

Compounding the anxiety surrounding the incident is a Tumblr page titled ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to serve as the bomber's manifesto. This online presence suggests a motive grounded in grievances related to societal oppression, specifically targeting the LGBTQ+ community and racial injustice. The individual associated with this digital manifesto has expressed clear disdain for a range of societal issues, asserting that the bombings were merely tests with future actions planned.

Another pressure-cooker bomb was discovered in a Dumpster nearby the original explosion site in Chelsea. This alarming find raises questions about the scale of the attack and the potential for additional threats in the area. As investigations continue, law enforcement is diligently working to uncover connections between the discovered bomb, the hand-written letter, and the manifesto, while striving to ensure public safety.

Authorities have yet to determine if the handwritten letter is directly tied to the attacker or if it serves as a broader statement reflecting on societal issues. Investigators are working tirelessly to analyze the Arabic text and understand its implications, hoping it might provide insight into the motives or future plans of the assailant.

The Chelsea bombing incident has heightened fears across New York City, with community members expressing anxiety over the possibility of further violence. Local leaders are calling for increased vigilance and support from residents as the investigation unfolds. There are calls for both mental health resources and additional security measures to ensure that individuals feel safe and protected in their neighborhoods.

As information continues to emerge, the investigation remains a top priority for city officials and law enforcement agencies. The eerily timed 911 call, paired with the inflammatory content of the online manifesto, underscores the urgency of the situation as investigators race against the clock to prevent further violence and apprehend those responsible for the chaos.

Public response to the incidents has been one of shock and concern, with many individuals expressing solidarity with those affected by the bombing. Social media platforms have seen an outpouring of support for the victims and discussions surrounding the societal issues mentioned in the manifesto. Advocates are urging deeper conversations about oppression, seeking to address the grievances cited in the online claims in order to foster a safer and more equitable society for all.

As New Yorkers grapple with the aftermath of the Chelsea bombing, the investigation into the person or persons responsible remains active. Authorities are imploring anyone with information related to the case to come forward as they strive to bring those behind these violent acts to justice while ensuring the safety of the community.",-25.0,-21.0,574.0,-0.9259259259259259,-0.04355400696864112,632.0,-0.9130434782608695,-0.03322784810126582
Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

With less than 24 hours until a pivotal debate against Hillary Clinton, questions regarding Donald Trump's mental fitness are intensifying. The 70-year-old former president has been on the campaign trail tirelessly, with little rest, raising concerns among both supporters and opponents about his ability to perform effectively on the debate stage.

In a startling display of stress and mental disconnection, Trump took to Twitter, posting an incoherent message that combined three unrelated topics: a shooting in Washington State, drug overdoses in Ohio, and riots in North Carolina. This chaotic message sparked immediate speculation about his state of mind and left many wondering if he is fully prepared for the upcoming face-off.

The varied and seemingly random nature of Trump’s tweet suggests a wandering mind, raising red flags about his mental readiness just before what could be a defining moment for his campaign. Observers are starting to question if the former president's relentless schedule and pressure from his campaign commitments are taking a toll on his mental acuity.

As the debate looms closer, the stakes are high. Trump’s performance could significantly impact voter perceptions and his campaign's trajectory. Analysts point to moments like this as critical, suggesting that they not only shape the immediate political landscape but also carry implications for Trump’s future in the race.

This latest incident underlines the growing concern that Trump’s approach to the campaign may have drawbacks, especially regarding his ability to communicate effectively under pressure. Voters and political analysts alike are watching closely, as the clarity of his message and his mental fitness may play crucial roles in the debate, potentially swaying undecided voters or solidifying existing support.

With all eyes on the stage, the question remains: is Trump mentally fit for the challenges that lie ahead?

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Delaware, Ohio—In a surprising turn of events, Hillary Clinton's much-anticipated door-knocking event held on Saturday afternoon at 1 PM garnered little public interest, raising questions about the viability of her campaign in the lead-up to the upcoming elections. What was expected to be a gathering of enthusiastic volunteers resulted in the presence of just one individual: a Donald Trump supporter who arrived to document the occasion.

As Clinton’s team prepared for the event, expectations were high. The campaign had equipped the office with materials and staff that indicated a belief that many volunteers would show up to support Clinton's efforts to rally grassroots enthusiasm. However, the turnout fell drastically short of these expectations, with only campaign staffers in attendance when the event commenced.

The solitary Trump supporter drew the attention of Clinton's campaign team, who, upon recognizing him as an attendee with opposing views, requested that he leave the event. This incident underscored an unusual moment in the campaign, highlighting the stark contrast in engagement levels between the two presidential contenders. While Clinton struggled to muster attendance in Ohio, Donald Trump’s rallies have consistently attracted thousands, underscoring a significant gap in enthusiasm and support for both candidates.

This disappointing turnout for Clinton’s door-knocking initiative raises pressing concerns about her campaign’s effectiveness, especially in battleground states where ground-game strategies are critical. In a political landscape where voter engagement can pivot the outcome of elections, the lack of volunteer involvement reflects broader issues regarding enthusiasm for Clinton's candidacy.

The uneventful event in Ohio speaks to a wider narrative that has been building around Clinton’s campaign. Speculation about her electoral chances continues to circulate, particularly as she faces ongoing scrutiny over various controversies that have plagued her candidacy. As the political climate intensifies and the election date approaches, questions about voter support are increasingly scrutinized. The stark contrast between Clinton’s dwindling attendance and Trump’s enthusiastic rallies only serves to amplify these concerns.

In summary, what was intended to be a vibrant door-knocking initiative became emblematic of larger trends within the Clinton campaign. The single attendee—documenting the event as a curious observer—was a stark representation of a campaign grappling with low support and visibility. This incident brings to the forefront broader issues regarding campaign mechanics, voter engagement, and the realities of the current political landscape. As the election season progresses, Clinton's team will need to address these challenges, strive for a more active grassroots presence, and reevaluate their approach to effectively mobilize supporters in critical swing states like Ohio.",-7.0,21.0,567.0,-0.22580645161290322,-0.012345679012345678,489.0,1.1666666666666667,0.04294478527607362

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

In a shocking turn of events, a bombing occurred in New York City, prompting an outpouring of national concern regarding the safety of citizens and the country’s security measures. The incident has sparked discussions across various platforms, drawing particular attention from political figures and the media.

Former President Donald Trump was quick to respond to the event, unequivocally labeling it a ""bombing."" His prompt characterization of the situation, however, did not go without controversy. CNN’s coverage of the event drew significant scrutiny, especially regarding its editorial choices. The network faced criticism for editing footage, which excluded a statement made by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Clinton had also referred to the incident as a “bombing,” using the term in a similar context before Trump’s statement.

CNN's Jake Tapper voiced his disapproval of Trump’s remarks, highlighting that the network's omission of Clinton's prior usage of the term could lead to perceived bias. This editorial decision has raised questions about media impartiality, with many observers noting that selective reporting can shape public opinion and understanding of critical issues.

In response to CNN's actions, Trump did not hold back. He publicly condemned the network, labeling their reporting as “disgusting and disgraceful.” His comments reflect a broader narrative he has often communicated regarding the media, emphasizing an ideology that accuses various outlets of harboring bias against him and his viewpoints. Trump’s assertions point to a larger discourse on how the media covers incidents involving terrorism and the political implications stemming from such reporting.

During his comments following the bombing, Trump also took the opportunity to address broader issues linked to terrorism and refugee policies. He argued that past leadership has responded ineffectively to the threat of terrorism, calling for a reevaluation of existing strategies. Trump articulated a sentiment that leaders have been “stupid” in their approach, advocating for tougher policies that he believes are necessary to ensure national security.

Furthermore, Trump turned his gaze towards former President Barack Obama’s refugee acceptance plan, which proposed to bring in over 110,000 Syrian refugees. He expressed skepticism about the vetting process, claiming that genuine vetting was unfeasible and posing a significant security risk. The conversation around refugee policies often sparks heated debate, and Trump’s rhetoric seeks to underscore the potential danger he perceives in accepting large numbers of refugees without stringent background checks.

Moreover, Trump drew attention to Hillary Clinton’s plans regarding refugee intake, asserting that her proposed increases would exacerbate the security risks he has highlighted. This characterization of her plans has placed her in the crosshairs of criticism, portraying her policies as potentially harmful in the wake of national security threats.

As the situation continues to unfold, the bombing in New York City serves as a pivotal moment for discussions surrounding terrorism, media representation, and political rhetoric. The responses from Trump, CNN, and other political figures reflect the complex interplay between tragedy and the narratives constructed around it. 

As citizens process this alarming incident, it prompts a deeper reflection on not only the safety of the nation but also how information is disseminated and interpreted in times of crisis. The coming days and weeks will likely see continued discourse as officials and commentators weigh in on the implications of the bombing, the responses by public figures, and the media’s role in shaping the narrative.",-45.0,-35.0,623.0,-2.5,-0.07223113964686999,649.0,-1.4583333333333333,-0.053929121725731895

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

In a striking development, Ahmad Rahami, a figure known for his prior convictions related to terrorism and murder, has initiated a federal lawsuit against the Elizabeth, New Jersey police, alleging discrimination against his family based on cultural grounds. This lawsuit, filed in Newark, has stirred significant attention given Rahami’s controversial history.

Rahami, along with his father, Mohammed Sr., and brother, Mohammed, contend that they have faced systematic discrimination since they opened their family-owned chicken restaurant in 2002. The lawsuit claims that local officials have employed various measures to undermine the business, including issuing numerous tickets and court summons that the family argues are unfounded. They assert that this treatment is rooted in bias against their Afghan heritage and Islamic identity.

In their legal complaint, the Rahami family alleges they were subjected to racial abuse from community residents who reportedly voiced their sentiments with statements like, ""Muslims don’t belong here."" It is indicated that these allegations build on a narrative of exclusion and hostility directed specifically toward their cultural background.

The family's claims extend to accusations of harassment and retaliation from authorities. They assert that police targeted them for operating their restaurant beyond 10 PM, despite having the proper permissions to do so. This element of the lawsuit raises questions about the extent of lawful authority exercised by the police and whether it crosses the line into discrimination based on cultural identity.

Adding to the complexities of the case are the allegations made by the police themselves, suggesting that the restaurant’s location was wrought with issues of ""too much crime."" They purportedly labeled the area as ""known for criminal activity,"" a characterization the Rahami family staunchly disputes in their lawsuit. The family contends that these accusations served only to vilify their business without just cause.

The timing of the lawsuit is particularly poignant, as Ahmad Rahami’s history includes a significant arrest five years ago connected to bomb-related activities. This stark contrast from operating a small business to being involved in extremist acts underscores the dramatic trajectory of his life. It raises eyebrows regarding the interplay of community perception and the realities of individual actions over time.

Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

The Clinton Foundation, which has long been at the center of scrutiny regarding its financial practices, faced renewed criticism amid ongoing allegations of pay-to-play corruption involving former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. These allegations prompted heightened examination of the foundation's allocation of funds during the 2014 fiscal year.

In response to the swirling controversies, the Clinton campaign sought to highlight the foundation's positive contributions to global health and education initiatives. However, detractors argue that the foundation has primarily operated as a profit-making venture for the Clintons and their associates, rather than focusing on genuine charitable outreach.

IRS filings reveal a troubling snapshot of the foundation's financial operations in 2014. Of its approximately $91.3 million budget, a paltry 5.7%, equating to less than $5.2 million, was dedicated to charitable grants. This figure stands in stark contrast to the foundation's substantial expenditures. A notable $34.8 million was allocated for salaries and employee benefits, while an additional $50.4 million was classified under ""other expenses."" Such figures raise questions about the foundation’s commitment to philanthropic pursuits.

Furthermore, 2014 marked a significant decrease in charitable funding, plummeting by 40% compared to 2013, despite the foundation reporting an increase of $30 million in income. The financial narrative of the foundation becomes even more perplexing when considering that salaries and associated costs rose by $5 million in 2014 versus the previous year, highlighting an increasing internal focus at the expense of charitable disbursements.

Critics contend that these financial allocations paint a clear picture: the Clinton Foundation was more focused on wealth generation for the Clintons rather than addressing charitable concerns. The disparity between the foundation’s income and its charitable payouts has fueled skepticism regarding its operational integrity and motivations.

As the discourse surrounding the Clinton Foundation continues, questions linger about its prioritization of spending and the implications of its financial practices. The foundation’s ability to effectively contribute to philanthropic causes remains under scrutiny as partisans on both sides of the aisle respond to the respective claims and defenses surrounding its activities and history.

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

In the wake of recent violent incidents in the United States, President Obama has come under fire for his response, or lack thereof, during a speech delivered in New York. The President's failure to address the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as a stabbing in Minnesota, has left many outraged and questioning his priorities amid a climate of increasing violence.

During the speech, which was primarily focused on a high-dollar fundraiser, Obama opted to discuss issues related to sexism and the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. This decision was met with immediate backlash, as critics accused him of being tone-deaf and insensitive to the gravity of the events transpiring on American soil. The absence of any mention of the victims affected by the recent explosions has further fueled public anger towards the President.

Amidst the mounting criticism, some defenders of Obama have suggested that his silence could be attributed to a lack of sufficient information at the time to make an informed statement about the attacks. This justification, however, has done little to quell the outcry from those who feel that the President should have at least acknowledged the impact of the violence on the American public.

The attacks, which have left communities shaken and on edge, have dominated news cycles in recent days. For many, the expectation was that the President of the United States would take a moment to address the nation’s concerns, offer condolences to the victims, and provide reassurance in a time of uncertainty. Instead, Obama’s focus on campaign-related topics during such a critical moment has raised questions about his sensitivity to domestic issues.

Critics have expressed strong disapproval of what they perceive to be a significant misstep in the President’s priorities. The juxtaposition of a fundraising event with the serious nature of recent events has led some to believe that Obama is out of touch with the realities faced by everyday Americans. Many argue that a leader's role includes not only addressing policy but also showing empathy and solidarity with those affected by violence and tragedy.

Social media has echoed these sentiments, with numerous users expressing their frustration over the President's apparent neglect of these pressing issues. Hashtags related to the bombings and stabbings quickly began to trend, igniting a conversation about the need for political leaders to respond appropriately to acts of violence and their repercussions on society.

As the public continues to grapple with the aftermath of these incidents, the expectation for thoughtful responses from their leaders remains paramount. Critics argue that President Obama missed a critical opportunity to unite the country in a moment of grief and uncertainty. The President's choices during this pivotal time will likely be scrutinized as the nation reflects on the importance of leadership in times of crisis.

In conclusion, the overwhelming response to Obama’s remarks—or lack thereof—illustrates a broader conversation about the responsibilities of public officials to engage with pressing issues that resonate with the populace. Moving forward, many are hopeful that political leaders will strike a balance between addressing campaign priorities and acknowledging the realities faced by the citizens they serve. As the country looks to heal, the desire for empathetic and informed leadership remains a vital component of the national dialogue.",-25.0,-52.0,573.0,-1.1363636363636365,-0.04363001745200698,613.0,-2.4761904761904763,-0.08482871125611746
Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

A recent report has shed light on serious issues regarding the Clinton Foundation, particularly during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. Increased scrutiny around the foundation has revealed that it may be grappling with more significant problems than the public was previously aware of.

Central to the report is the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), which has come under fire for allegedly distributing ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa. This alarming claim raises substantial health concerns, as a draft congressional report suggests that these diluted drugs may have heightened the risks for patients who rely on them for treatment.

CHAI is widely regarded as one of the Clinton Foundation's most impactful initiatives, contributing significantly to global health efforts. However, the recent revelations could have lingering consequences, particularly for Hillary Clinton's aspirations in the political arena as she positions herself for a possible presidential run.

The report further delves into connections between Bill Clinton and controversial Indian-American figures, currently under investigation by U.S. agencies such as the FDA and SEC. Such associations cast a shadow over the foundation's operations and its commitment to ethical practices.

Particular concerns have been raised regarding the Clinton Foundation's promotion of Ranbaxy, a pharmaceutical company with a documented history of quality control issues. The implications of this endorsement, especially in connection with the delivery of compromised HIV/AIDS treatments, have provoked a demand for accountability.

Amidst ongoing inquiries, uncertainty lingers regarding the total number of patients who may have received these compromised drugs. The report concludes with a call for the immediate shutdown of the Clinton Foundation to prevent further harm, underscoring the urgency of addressing these troubling findings before they affect more individuals. The forthcoming weeks may be critical as stakeholders evaluate the implications of this report for both the foundation and Hillary Clinton's political future.",-14.0,-4.0,349.0,-1.1666666666666667,-0.04011461318051576,350.0,-0.3076923076923077,-0.011428571428571429
Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all.

The Arizona state legislature is facing mounting criticism over poorly worded bills that have raised alarms among parents and legal experts alike. Recent legislation has unexpectedly criminalized what many consider normal parenting activities, transforming everyday actions into potential legal transgressions.

One of the most contentious laws aims to criminalize any contact between an adult and a child's genitals. This definition, while primarily established to safeguard children from molestation, has inadvertently put parents in a precarious position. Actions that are part and parcel of responsible childcare, such as changing diapers or bathing a child, could now be viewed through a legal lens that equates caregiving with criminal intent.

While the intention behind the law is to protect vulnerable children from potential abuse, the implications for innocent parental behavior are alarming. The Arizona Supreme Court has backed the legislation, reassuring the public that prosecutors are unlikely to pursue charges against parents for innocent actions. However, this assurance may not alleviate concerns regarding how the law is structured and its broader implications for parental rights.

Notably, the burden of proof has shifted under this law, requiring defendants to establish a lack of sexual intent. This shift raises significant concerns about the foundational legal principle of presumption of innocence. With defendants now facing a heightened scrutiny that demands they prove their innocence, legal experts warn that this redefinition could lead to unjust outcomes.

John Pfaff, a legal scholar, points out that the ramifications extend beyond just the courtroom. He notes that the mechanisms of plea bargaining—where defendants may feel pressured to accept guilty pleas to avoid harsher penalties—could exacerbate the situation. This leverage may give prosecutors undue power, potentially coercing parents into plea deals by threatening serious criminal charges for actions that most would classify as everyday caregiving.

As a result, many Arizona residents are now at risk of being categorized as unknowing criminals. The potential for misuse of the law has left numerous caregivers feeling vulnerable and suspect under a system that seems to overlook the nuances of parental intention. Critics argue that this is a severe affront to constitutional rights, particularly in the context of due process.

Adding to the complexity, there are rising concerns regarding the lack of intervention from higher courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. Advocates for parents' rights are calling for a reassessment of the legislative language to prevent the potential abuse of power by law enforcement and prosecutors. The prospect of facing criminal charges for innocent, habitual parenting practices has turned what should be a nurturing environment into a realm of fear for many caregivers.

In summary, while the Arizona state legislature aims to provide a shield for children against molesters, the unintended consequences of such measures point to an urgent need for clarity and protection of innocent parenting activities. As legal battles loom and public uproar builds, the discussion surrounding the balance between safeguarding children and preserving parents' rights is likely to remain at the forefront of Arizona’s legal landscape.",-12.0,-50.0,517.0,-0.5,-0.02321083172147002,559.0,-2.272727272727273,-0.08944543828264759
Fake_73-Webpage,Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?,"Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

× 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

As the political landscape shifts with Hillary Clinton's recent electoral victory, speculation is swirling around Michelle Obama and the potential roles she might assume in a Clinton administration. Following the election, discussions have reignited concerning the continued media focus on the Obamas, raising concerns about the implications of their prolonged public presence over the forthcoming four years.

Critics have emerged, expressing unease regarding the Obamas' ongoing narrative in the media, suggesting that the public may need a break from what has become a familiar and, for some, a contentious story. The critiques extend to Michelle Obama's legacy, particularly her initiatives aimed at reforming school lunches. Detractors have labeled these efforts as ineffective, questioning the long-term impact of her campaign on childhood health and nutrition.

Despite the challenges to her legacy, Michelle Obama's impact extends beyond school lunch reforms. She has been a strong advocate for various social issues, and her activism has often resonated deeply with the public. Notable among her initiatives was the “#BringBackOurGirls” campaign, which sought to raise awareness about the kidnapping of Nigerian schoolgirls by the militant group Boko Haram. This campaign exemplified her ability to galvanize support for urgent global issues, highlighting her potential to influence policy and public sentiment through grassroots movements.

However, as discussions of her qualifications for any new roles within a potential Clinton administration arise, skepticism lingers. Many are questioning whether her experience aligns with the demands of governmental positions. The complexities of governance require a specific skill set and background that could differ markedly from the activism and celebrity status associated with the former First Lady.

Key to this conversation is Hillary Clinton's stance on the role of government in child-rearing. Clinton has long maintained a belief that the government should play an active role in the upbringing of children, advocating for policies that extend support and resources to families. This perspective presents a potential alignment with Michelle Obama's commitment to promoting healthy living and nutrition for children, which she has framed as a long-term vision that could benefit future generations.

Nevertheless, there are concerns about the implications of a progressive approach to education that encourages government involvement in shaping the values and health choices of young citizens. Critics warn that such involvement risks fostering a narrative where the government acts as a parental unit, which could lead to uncomfortable realities regarding autonomy in education and child-rearing.

Furthermore, there exists a growing discomfort with the notion of possible indoctrination that may arise through expanded government influence in American children's education. The apprehension centers around whether children's educational experiences might increasingly reflect a government-driven ideology, potentially alienating families with differing views on parenting and education.

As these discussions unfold, the cultural significance of the Obamas and their legacy continues to be scrutinized. While Michelle Obama's initiatives aimed at promoting children's health reflect a genuine commitment to improving lives, the effectiveness of these programs is still a matter of debate. The question remains: will her vision and values find a place within a Clinton administration, and if so, how will they be implemented in a way that resonates positively across a diverse American populace?

As the political drama continues, the country watches closely to see what role, if any, Michelle Obama might take on in this new chapter of governance, and whether her legacy will evolve or diminish under renewed scrutiny and shifting political tides.",6.0,16.0,580.0,0.2608695652173913,0.010344827586206896,643.0,0.6956521739130435,0.024883359253499222

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

A new scandal has emerged involving the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), raising serious allegations of negligence in the distribution of HIV/AIDS medications. Reports suggest that the initiative may have provided ""watered-down"" drugs, significantly increasing mortality risks for many patients in Africa.

The controversy centers around Ranbaxy, an Indian drug manufacturer previously found guilty of fraud and distributing adulterated medications. In 2013, the Department of Justice leveled a hefty $500 million fine against Ranbaxy for its deceptive practices, including the production of substandard drugs that failed to meet safety and efficacy standards.

The allegations come to light following a recent congressional report spearheaded by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, which investigates the connections between the Clintons and Ranbaxy. Blackburn has raised questions concerning the Clintons' awareness of the quality of pills distributed under their initiative, highlighting her concerns about the loss of lives attributable to the “false promises” of the medications.

The implications of this report are serious and troubling. Despite documented evidence of Ranbaxy's poor quality control measures and previous fraudulent activities, the Clinton Foundation maintained a promotion of the manufacturer. Critics argue that this relationship raises alarming questions about the foundation's priorities, suggesting a troubling inclination toward financial gain over the health and safety of vulnerable populations.

The scope of the problem remains fluid, with an unclear number of patients reported to have received these substandard medications. However, it is widely believed that the distribution of diluted drugs has resulted in countless deaths among those relying on these treatments for survival. 

In 2007, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) allocated substantial funds to Ranbaxy, further linking the initiative to the questionable practices of the drug manufacturer. Alarmingly, while Ranbaxy's generic drugs are banned within US borders due to their compromised quality, they continue to be distributed and sold in various markets across the globe.

The Clinton Foundation's ongoing ties to Ranbaxy have been met with accusations of rampant corruption. Observers are now questioning whether the initiative placed financial interests ahead of ethical health practices, potentially jeopardizing the wellbeing of patients in greatest need.

In light of these developments, Blackburn has been vocal about the implications of the report, stressing the urgency to hold those accountable for the alleged mishandling of drug distribution. She contends that many lives could have been saved if the medications provided had been safe and effective, urging an immediate investigation into the practices of both CHAI and Ranbaxy.

As further details regarding this scandal unfold, it is imperative to examine the ethical dimensions of pharmaceutical accessibility, drug safety, and the responsibilities of health initiatives. The fallout from this scandal may extend beyond mere political ramifications; it raises fundamental questions about the trust placed in organizations committed to global health and the lives that hang in the balance due to mismanagement or negligence.

Families and communities affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic have already faced unprecedented challenges, and the possibility that substandard treatments were among the form of assistance provided is deeply concerning. Public health advocates now call for more stringent oversight of drug distribution practices, especially concerning high-stakes medications that are critical for life-saving treatments.

In conclusion, the allegations surrounding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and its dealings with Ranbaxy reflect a disturbing intersection of health policy, corporate misconduct, and the responsibilities of high-profile foundations. The pressing need for transparency and accountability is clear, especially as the investigation into these claims unfolds. The lives of many depend on the efficacy and safety of the medications they receive, making it essential that they are afforded the highest standard of care possible.

This emerging scandal not only calls into question the integrity of the Clinton Health Access Initiative but also raises an urgent demand for reforms in how health initiatives operate in partnership with pharmaceutical companies. Future policies must prioritize patient health over potential financial gains to prevent the tragic outcomes associated with such negligent practices. The stakes could not be higher, as the world watches closely to uncover the truth behind this alarming public health crisis.",-63.0,-43.0,819.0,-1.96875,-0.07692307692307693,757.0,-1.5925925925925926,-0.05680317040951123

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

A federal judge has mandated that the U.S. State Department release crucial documents concerning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides' completion of security training within a strict timeframe of five days. Judge Richard Leon, presiding over the case, ruled in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation (TheDCNF) after dismissing the State Department’s motion to throw out a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit.

TheFOIA lawsuit initiated by TheDCNF specifically targets records that would affirm whether Clinton and her key advisors, including Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, and Jacob Sullivan, underwent mandatory security briefings on the proper handling of classified materials. These briefings are a standard protocol intended to ensure that government officials are well-informed about the protocols for managing sensitive information.

Despite these requirements, the State Department has failed to produce any records that establish the completion of the necessary security training by Clinton and her aides. This lack of documentation has raised significant concerns and questions about compliance with security protocols during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.

Frustration with the State Department's continuing delays in the release of the documents was evident in Judge Leon's statements. His ruling set firm deadlines for the State Department to produce the requested information, requiring one-third of the documents to be released by September 26 and the remainder by October 10. These deadlines are designed to ensure the timely dissemination of information that could have implications for public trust and accountability.

Attorney Bradley Moss, who is involved in the case, highlighted that the failure to meet these deadlines could result in ramifications for the State Department. The potential consequences underscore the judiciary's growing impatience with the executive branch's handling of transparency-related matters, notably those connected to high-profile public officials.

In a previous statement, officials from the State Department acknowledged their inability to provide the requested documents. This admission implies that the necessary training courses may not have been completed by Clinton and her aides, raising further questions about their adherence to established security protocols. The implications of this revelation could prove significant, given the longstanding concerns over the use of personal email accounts for official communications during Clinton's time in office.

The themes emerging from this ruling highlight the ongoing tension between transparency and national security, a balance that has been scrutinized extensively in recent years. The handling of classified information by government officials is a sensitive issue that necessitates adherence to established guidelines—something that the current legal proceedings seek to clarify regarding Clinton and her aides.

This case has not only rekindled interest in Clinton's time as Secretary of State but also has broader implications for the handling of classified materials within the government. The outcome may contribute to a larger dialogue about the accountability of government officials and the need for rigorous enforcement of security protocols.

As the situation unfolds, all eyes will be on the State Department's compliance with Judge Leon's order. The next few weeks will be pivotal in determining whether the agency will meet the deadlines set forth by the court, ultimately impacting public perception and trust surrounding the department's management of sensitive information.

In conclusion, the ruling by Judge Richard Leon reinforces the importance of transparency within government institutions and underscores the need for accountability among officials who are charged with handling classified information. The developments in this case could set a precedent for future inquiries and shape the conversation surrounding governmental oversight practices. As the release date for the documents looms, the implications of the case extend well beyond Clinton and her aides, touching upon the fabric of public trust in governmental operations.",-5.0,4.0,672.0,-0.1724137931034483,-0.00744047619047619,677.0,0.17391304347826086,0.005908419497784343
Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

- The absence of on-screen fact-checking from major cable news networks means Trump may make unchallenged statements.
- Nearly all major networks, including Univision and Telemundo, have announced they will not use on-screen graphics to fact-check the candidates' comments.
- The responsibility for keeping candidates honest will primarily fall on moderator Lester Holt.
- Politico reported that Trump lies, on average, every three-and-a-half minutes, highlighting the need for a fact-checking process.
- The media is perceived as prioritizing ratings over accountability, catering to Trump and his supporters.
- Clinton's campaign is striving to hold Trump accountable, with Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri emphasizing the moderator's role in challenging lies.
- The debate dynamics suggest that Clinton may need to outperform despite a lack of support in countering Trump's inaccuracies.
- There is a perceived double standard, requiring Clinton to prove herself more than her opponent, who is considered less qualified.
- Concerns are raised about the current state of journalism in the context of the election.","As the first presidential debate approaches, significant questions loom regarding the strategy employed by major news networks. According to NBC News, moderator Lester Holt will refrain from fact-checking the candidates, particularly Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, during the highly anticipated event. This decision is stirring concern among commentators and analysts, as it raises the likelihood that Trump may deliver unchallenged statements, further complicating the already charged political atmosphere.

The absence of real-time, on-screen fact-checking is not limited to NBC; nearly all significant networks, including Univision and Telemundo, have announced similar policies. This shift means that the onus of accountability for candidates' remarks falls squarely on Holt's shoulders. While his responsibility as a moderator is critical, the lack of factual counterpoints from the networks could result in a debate environment where misleading claims go unaddressed.

Moreover, a report from Politico serves to underscore the urgency of a fact-checking mechanism in political discourse, revealing that Trump is known to lie approximately every three-and-a-half minutes. The implication is clear: without a structured effort to challenge falsehoods during the debate, misinformation may proliferate unchecked.

Critics argue that the media landscape seems to prioritize ratings over responsible journalism, suggesting that there is an inherent bias catering to Trump and his supporters. In such an environment, the risk of inadequate scrutiny becomes more pronounced. The Clinton campaign is keenly aware of this dynamic, with Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri advocating for a robust role for Holt in holding Trump accountable for his statements. Palmieri's stance emphasizes the importance of transparency in the political discourse when faced with deliberate mistruths.

As the debate dynamics unfold, many observers anticipate that Clinton will need to navigate these challenges adeptly, showcasing her qualifications while responding effectively to Trump's potential inaccuracies. Reports indicate a perceived double standard at play; Clinton is expected to prove her merit more acutely than her opponent, whose qualifications are often considered inferior by various metrics. The pressures on her to outperform in an environment lacking rigorous fact-checking raise further concerns.

Ultimately, these developments have generated a broader discussion about the current state of journalism and its ability to uphold the integrity of democratic processes. The absence of systematic fact-checking during pivotal moments in the electoral season not only challenges the candidates but also raises fundamental questions about how media can protect the public's right to informed discourse. As the debate nears, all eyes will be on Holt and the role he plays in guiding the conversation through the inevitable barrage of statements from both candidates.",-6.0,-3.0,454.0,-0.5,-0.013215859030837005,465.0,-0.16666666666666666,-0.0064516129032258064
Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

In a recent revelation, Dolly Kyle, a longtime acquaintance of Bill Clinton, has publicly shared her apprehensions regarding Hillary Clinton's suitability for the presidency. Kyle is the author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” a book in which she claims to expose troubling truths about Hillary Clinton, particularly regarding her health and emotional state.

Kyle describes Clinton as being ""angry and driven by rage,"" raising alarms about the potential impact this could have on her health and presidential capabilities. “I worry that this could lead to a physical breakdown,” Kyle articulated, suggesting that the emotional turmoil she perceives in Clinton may not only affect her mental state but could also manifest as serious health issues.

Adding to her concerns, Kyle asserts that Clinton exhibits signs of cognitive impairment, claiming she is not physically fit for the demanding role of president. “There are indicators of emotional instability, memory loss, and an inability to handle certain tasks effectively,” Kyle warned. These assertions have raised eyebrows as they come at a time when Hillary Clinton's capabilities and character are under intense scrutiny.

Kyle also points to what she describes as Clinton's paranoia and control issues, identifying these traits as particularly concerning for anyone seeking the highest office in the land. “Having such issues in a position of power is a dangerous combination,” she stated, suggesting that these traits could lead to erratic decision-making that might be detrimental not only to Clinton herself but also to the country.

In writing her book, Kyle aims to shed light on various aspects of Clinton’s character, with health being a central theme. She accused the former secretary of state of harboring an addiction to power, claiming this obsession could lead her to compromise her health and even the integrity of the Democratic Party in pursuit of her ambitions.

Furthermore, Kyle alleges that Clinton has been plotting to secure the presidency since the 1970s, leveraging her acquaintanceship with Bill Clinton as a stepping stone. 

This latest commentary serves as an additional setback for Hillary Clinton during a period rife with criticism of her health, character, and leadership capabilities. As the political landscape evolves, Kyle’s revelations may contribute to ongoing debates surrounding Clinton's readiness to assume the presidency once more.",-13.0,-11.0,424.0,-1.0,-0.030660377358490566,442.0,-0.7857142857142857,-0.024886877828054297

YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT THEY MUST INTEGRATE AND LEARN TO LIVE IN CANADA. NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO BE FOR THEM TO CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLE, NOT THE CANADIANS WHO SO GENEROUSLY WELCOMED THEM. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT CANADIANS ARE NOT RACIST OR XENOPHOBIC.

FOR THIS REASON, THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE. FINALLY, THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN CANADA, WITH ITS JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ROOTS, CHRISTMAS TREES, CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS, RELIGION MUST REMAIN IN THE PRIVATE SPHERE. THE MUNICIPALITY OF DURVAL HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY CONCESSIONS TO ISLAM AND SHARIA LAW. FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

As the conversation surrounding immigration policy continues to evolve across North America, a consensus emerges that calls for a more uniform approach while recognizing the rich tapestry of cultures that contribute to society. The debate highlights the importance of immigrants adapting to established customs and traditions. Advocates argue that while immigrants enrich the culture, they must also respect and integrate into the existing societal framework.

Recent statements from Quebec's mayor have sparked significant discussion around the integration of Muslim immigrants into Canadian culture. The mayor asserted that Muslims must make a concerted effort to embrace Canadian identity, emphasizing that the nation prides itself on being inclusive without compromising its core values. He contended that Canadians are neither racist nor xenophobic; rather, they are open to a multitude of cultures and religions, provided that these new identities harmonize with the Canadian way of life.

Central to the mayor's argument is the idea that while Canada welcomes diversity, the preservation of its identity and culture is paramount. He stressed that the integration process should not dilute the prevailing culture but instead encourage newcomers to weave their traditions into the Canadian framework without overshadowing it. This requires immigrants to navigate their adaptation through a lens of respect for the host society, fostering dialogue rather than division.

Further, the mayor made it clear that religion should remain a private matter and not interfere with public life. This assertion raises pertinent questions about the extent to which municipalities can assert their values, particularly in a diverse society. In this context, certain municipalities, like Dorval, are cited as having the prerogative to reject certain practices associated with Islamic culture, including Sharia law, which has caused controversy and reflection among immigrant communities.

The mayor's remarks also challenge immigrants to contemplate their decision to choose Canada over their countries of origin. By encouraging this self-reflection, he hopes to spur a deeper understanding of what it means to live in Canada, where adherence to local customs is not merely suggested, but expected. This entreaty for introspection emphasizes that immigration is not just an escape from the realities of one’s original homeland—it is also a commitment to a new life that necessitates an understanding of Canadian values and traditions.

Amidst these discussions, the perplexity surrounding foreign influences on American legal frameworks, particularly regarding the imposition of Sharia law, raises eyebrows. Many express concern over the integration of such norms into a predominantly non-Islamic legal system. The debate here revolves around the extent to which immigrants are allowed to maintain traditional practices, with many advocates suggesting they should bring their cultural practices into the fold without imposing them upon the majority population.

In reinforcing these sentiments, some voices within the community assert that the expectation for immigrants should be clear: the imperative to integrate into the established culture. This viewpoint underscores the notion that to be part of a nation, individuals must commit to understanding and adopting the prevailing societal norms. The message is straightforward—while cultural diversity is celebrated, the essential call for integration remains paramount.

As the dialogue around immigration and integration in North America takes center stage, it is clear that communities are grappling with the balance between welcoming newcomers and preserving their cultural identity. The challenge remains to cultivate an environment where diverse cultures can coexist without challenging the foundational tenets of society. The pathway forward will likely require difficult conversations, introspection, and a commitment to mutual respect—a delicate balancing act that defines the ongoing immigration discourse.",12.0,23.0,577.0,0.4444444444444444,0.02079722703639515,653.0,0.9583333333333334,0.03522205206738132

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

In a recent incident amid the chaos of protests in North Carolina, a white man found himself surrounded by demonstrators from the Black Lives Matter movement during a time of unrest. The situation unfolded as tensions were high, with reports of rioters halting and looting cargo trucks in the vicinity.

A witnessing photographer captured the moment, initially expecting the man to be mugged or confronted by the protesters. However, in a surprising turn of events, the crowd allowed the man to pass through without incident. This unexpected behavior from the demonstrators has sparked conversations about the dynamics at play during such highly charged environments.

As the man attempted to navigate through the crowd, he displayed a handgun out of his car window. This display of armament seemed to have a decisive effect, as the group quickly dispersed, creating a path for him to continue driving. The incident raises critical questions about his response and the implications of wielding a firearm in tense situations.

The North Carolina community is left pondering the best methods for handling encounters with hostile groups. The juxtaposition of peaceful protestors and aggressive actions, such as the reported looting of cargo trucks, adds complexity to the conversation. Many local residents and activists are calling for strategies centered around de-escalation and dialogue rather than confrontation, emphasizing the importance of maintaining peace during protests.

The incident illustrates the volatility that can arise in protest scenarios, and it serves as a reminder of the differing attitudes individuals take when faced with potentially threatening situations. As discussions continue surrounding social justice and community safety, the actions taken by the man and the response of the protesters provide a unique perspective on the challenges faced by both sides during times of civil unrest. 

As North Carolina grapples with these issues in the wake of recent protests, the broader implications of the incident will likely shape community responses and conversations about how to effectively navigate the complexities of protest environments in the future.",-18.0,-13.0,383.0,-0.9473684210526315,-0.04699738903394256,371.0,-0.9285714285714286,-0.03504043126684636

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

In a scathing commentary, critics are calling out Chicago environmentalists for what they perceive as hypocrisy in their project support, often tied to political affiliations. This notion is particularly evident in the contrasting stances these groups have taken regarding two high-profile developments: George Lucas's proposed museum and the Obama Presidential Center.

According to a report from the Washington Times, environmentalists who vehemently opposed Lucas's museum—ultimately leading to its abandonment after a protracted two-year legal battle—now express enthusiasm for the construction of the Obama center. Juanita Irizarry, the executive director of Friends of the Parks, recently shared her excitement about the Obama center's development. This shift in support raises questions about the motivations behind such decisions.

Critics argue that the environmentalists’ choice to oppose the museum, which was slated for an existing parking lot, while advocating for the Obama center—which necessitates clearing trees and grass—contradicts their own charter. This inconsistency raises broader concerns about the integrity of liberal ideology and the political framework in Chicago.

Moreover, the article insinuates a racial bias behind these environmental decisions, positing that the desire to prioritize development projects associated with prominent political figures, such as the ""black man's library,"" overshadows the value of projects backed by individuals like Lucas, perceived as representative of a ""white guy's"" interests.

In an era where environmentalism is often touted as a nonpartisan issue, the apparent duplicity displayed by these groups challenges long-held beliefs and underlines the complexities of political maneuvering in Chicago. This critique serves as a reminder for environmentalists to align their practices with their professed values.",3.0,6.0,303.0,0.1875,0.009900990099009901,308.0,0.5454545454545454,0.01948051948051948

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

General Stanley McChrystal, the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan, found his military career hanging in the balance after a series of disagreements with President Barack Obama regarding the conduct of the war. Their contentious relationship culminated in a pivotal meeting in the Oval Office, where McChrystal entered with the expectation that he was about to end his tenure in the Army.

During the meeting, tensions came to a head as Obama accused McChrystal of failing to support him in his political role as Commander-in-Chief. In response, McChrystal asserted his commitment to uphold his duty to the President. In a decisive moment, he submitted his resignation, indicating that he understood the seriousness of the situation.

The article suggests that Obama harbored a negative perception of the military and its personnel, complicating the dynamic between the Commander-in-Chief and his top general. This strained relationship was underscored by a parting remark from Obama, which implied satisfaction at the notion of McChrystal’s departure.

Fake_81-Webpage,SURPRISE! 70% Of Charlotte RIOTERS Are Not From There – Guess What That Means… [VIDEO],"SURPRISE! 70% Of Charlotte RIOTERS Are Not From There – Guess What That Means… [VIDEO]

Imagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm. Shut up. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now Take it away CNN… “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down. It’s what communists do – they want their revolution and race wars and they want them now.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/surprise-70-charlotte-rioters-not-guess-means-video/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bus.png,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474651120000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/ag5lEfilclE,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bus.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bus-890x395_c.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/surprise-70-charlotte-rioters-not-guess-means-video/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""Imagine that\u2026 at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in.

CHARLOTTE, NC—An alarming trend has emerged from the recent riots in Charlotte, North Carolina, where at least 70% of those arrested for rioting have been identified as out-of-state individuals. Documentation and IDs have confirmed this surprising statistic, raising concerns about the true nature of the unrest that has gripped the city.

Local law enforcement and community leaders have labeled the situation as systematic and orchestrated by radical outside influences. Police union head has gone so far as to refer to those instigating chaos as ""professional criminals."" This assertion has been echoed by various sources, suggesting that the disturbances in Charlotte are not the spontaneous outpourings of an organic protest movement but rather a calculated attempt to create disorder.

One particularly inflammatory claim within the discourse surrounding the riots is the assertion that organized protests are being manipulated by what some have labeled ""communists."" These radical elements allegedly use the widely recognized Black Lives Matter movement as a tool to stoke unrest and promote a larger revolutionary agenda. The characterization of the unrest as a manifestation of a desire for racial conflicts and societal upheaval has raised complex questions regarding the motivations driving the rioters who have descended upon Charlotte from across state lines.

Comparative analyses have also been drawn to similar situations occurring in other locations, such as Tulsa. Observers noted that the intensity of rioting in Tulsa was markedly less than in Charlotte. Factors contributing to this disparity have been attributed to the local demographics and the surrounding circumstances, including a police officer facing charges of manslaughter. This contrast in the behavior of protesters and rioters across regions suggests that local context may play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of unrest.

Further complicating this narrative are claims that the out-of-state participants involved in the Charlotte riots were not genuine protesters. Instead, they have been described as criminals, intent on instigating chaos rather than advocating for racial justice. This perspective challenges the broader efforts of those genuinely seeking to address systemic issues and champion reform.

Witnesses on the ground in Charlotte have reported witnessing organized marches that quickly devolved into acts of violence, leading to confrontations with law enforcement. The methodical nature with which some of these riots have unfolded has led Atlanta Police Department and community leaders to question the motivations of those taking part.

High-ranking police officials and community stakeholders are calling for a return to civil discourse and a focus on constructive engagement rather than chaos and destruction. They urge genuine proponents of change to distance themselves from groups that adopt violent tactics under the guise of protest.

As communities grapple with the realities of civil unrest and its implications on local safety and cohesion, the situation in Charlotte serves as a striking reminder of the complexities surrounding protests and their potential for escalation. The overwhelming presence of out-of-state actors raises critical questions about the dynamics of mobilization and the roles played by those who are not rooted in local contexts.

In conclusion, the observations made in Charlotte reflect a larger narrative about the changing landscape of protests and the interplay of local versus external influences. With tensions remaining high and communities seeking healing, the hope is to redirect the efforts toward meaningful dialogue and respect for the voices that truly need to be heard.",-17.0,-38.0,617.0,-0.4594594594594595,-0.027552674230145867,609.0,-1.6521739130434783,-0.06239737274220033

As Hillary Clinton continues her bid for the presidency, her health has emerged as a pivotal topic of discussion. Initially dismissed as mere conspiracy theories, concerns surrounding her health, including allegations of serious neurological diseases, have gained newfound traction among the public and media.

The scrutiny intensified following a troubling incident on September 11th, when Clinton collapsed during a public event. This event raised alarms about her health and led to increased speculation regarding her well-being. Expert Clif Hite has suggested a controversial theory positing that Clinton may have actually died and been replaced with body doubles and computer-generated images. If substantiated, this theory could mark one of the most significant cover-ups in American political history.

Adding to the intrigue, Russian intelligence agencies have reportedly lent credence to these claims, asserting Clinton has not made public appearances outside her daughter's apartment and is allegedly using lookalikes. Further fueling the conspiracy, journalists Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan have introduced allegations of a secret plane crash that purportedly caused severe injuries to Clinton.

As these discussions unfold, the article encourages readers to weigh in on the emerging theories regarding Clinton's health and the implications surrounding her potential injury or replacement.

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC.

In a significant development this election cycle, Discover the Networks has reported on an extensive network of entities financially supported by billionaire financier George Soros that are aiming their efforts squarely at discrediting presidential candidate Donald Trump. Among these is a newly formed organization, the Common Defense PAC, which has emerged as a vocal opponent of Trump and is backed by Soros funding.

Common Defense PAC presents itself as a champion for the rights of all Americans, asserting that it is a collective of military veterans standing in opposition to Trump’s vision and policies. However, the PAC’s leadership page lists various military veterans without providing any direct contact information, raising questions about transparency and accountability within the organization.

Dominating its media presence, the PAC shares an array of anti-Trump video advertisements and actively promotes content produced by other PACs also funded by Soros. Through the use of digital platforms, Common Defense PAC has crafted an online narrative that promotes the hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump. This campaign has garnered additional traction through its collaboration with MoveOn.org, which has actively advertised the hashtag via its Political Action arm.

The momentum of the #VetsAgainstTrump initiative is reinforced by a Thunderclap campaign titled #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump, which reportedly reached over 4.5 million individuals. This ambitious outreach has helped consolidate voices from across the veteran community who are critical of Trump’s policies and rhetoric.

In a coordinated effort, Common Defense PAC and MoveOn.org have also organized protests against Trump. A notable target of their demonstrations has been Republican Senator John McCain, who they urged to withdraw his endorsement for the presidential candidate. Such actions highlight the PAC's commitment to mobilizing grassroots opposition to Trump, positioning itself as a powerful political player leading the charge among veteran voices.

However, the PAC’s financial disclosures paint a curious picture. A review of their July filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) indicates that the organization received support from only one donor – a Baltimore IT consultant who contributed $20,000. This raises questions about the overall financial backing and sustainability of the organization, leading observers to wonder how reliant it may be on the larger Soros funding apparatus.

Perry O’Brien, serving as the director of Common Defense PAC, stands out as a prominent figure within the organization. Known for his history as a long-time leftist activist and conscientious objector, O’Brien’s profile does not align with conventional veteran representation. His political activism has included efforts such as organizing petitions urging Republican leaders to disavow Donald Trump and his controversial remarks regarding veterans, which further solidifies his anti-Trump stance.

As the campaign ramps up, the influence of groups like Common Defense PAC, buoyed by Soros's financial support, poses critical questions for Trump's campaign strategy. The aggressive tactics and concerted messaging efforts from these organizations raise concerns about whether Trump's campaign can effectively counter the narratives and mobilization efforts being propagated by such powerful coalitions.

Through the utilization of social media and direct action campaigns, organizations like Common Defense PAC are aiming to reshape the discourse surrounding Trump, leveraging the veteran narrative to garner broader support while challenging his credibility. Observers of the political landscape are closely monitoring how these dynamics will evolve as the election approaches, particularly in the context of Trump's already polarizing presence within the electorate.

In the face of Soros-funded attacks and a burgeoning opposition front, Trump's campaign will need to navigate a complex web of opposition strategies and messaging. The effectiveness of his response to these coordinated efforts may prove pivotal in determining the outcome of the upcoming election, with the influence of veteran-led groups like Common Defense PAC playing a significant role in the unfolding political narrative.",8.0,50.0,694.0,0.34782608695652173,0.011527377521613832,701.0,2.0833333333333335,0.07132667617689016

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

A recent investigation by CBS has uncovered a substantial and controversial allocation of $770 million in taxpayer money by the Obama State Department for the renovation of overseas mosques. This funding, dating back to 2015, has ignited a firestorm of criticism from taxpayer advocates and raised serious concerns about the potential implications of supporting groups that could be linked to terrorism.

The allocation of such a significant sum of taxpayer dollars has been met with outrage, particularly from those who believe that this expenditure undermines the financial stability of the United States. As American citizens face varied economic challenges, critics argue that directing funds toward the renovation of religious institutions abroad is both irresponsible and unsustainable.

Jared Thomas, a prominent taxpayer advocate, has voiced strong opposition to the financial commitment referenced in the investigation. He emphasized the precarious nature of this spending, likening it to using a ""gigantic credit card” that could lead to dangerous fiscal consequences. Thomas’s remarks underscore the notion that resources should instead be focused on solving domestic issues rather than on projects that might not directly benefit the American populace.

In defense of the funding, the State Department asserts that these financial efforts are part of a larger strategy to combat Islamic extremism and to foster positive relationships with Islamic leaders. Officials have described the investments as critical to countering radicalization by showing support for moderate voices within the Muslim community. However, critics retort that these initiatives may inadvertently create pathways for funding that could end up supporting terrorist organizations, thus compromising safety and security interests in the U.S.

Navigating the complex waters of international relations, the allocation of funds for overseas mosque renovations also brings to the forefront additional concerns regarding the potential long-term implications of these financial initiatives. Accusations have arisen that such foreign aid could indirectly support Islamic terrorists, raising eyebrows among Americans who are cautious about the government’s role in international funding.

Moreover, the issue of resettlement of Muslim refugees in the United States adds another layer of concern for those uneasy with the implications of these financial decisions. The potential for demographic shifts resulting from such resettlement efforts has, in part, fueled fears that these changes could significantly influence future voting patterns. Critics argue that taxpayer money should be prioritized for local needs and services, especially in a climate where many Americans are struggling to make ends meet.

Despite the mounting concerns and criticisms, the State Department has opted not to provide further details on the rationale behind these expenditures, declining an interview request to clarify their intent with the allocated funds. This lack of transparency has only intensified scrutiny of the decision-making process regarding such significant taxpayer funds.

The fallout from this revelation continues, with taxpayer advocates urging a reevaluation of the priorities that guide governmental funding. They call for a redirection of resources to more immediate and pressing needs within the United States, rather than investing in projects abroad that could inadvertently jeopardize national security.

As the debate rages on, the allocation of taxpayer money for the renovation of mosques overseas raises critical questions about fiscal responsibility, governmental priorities, and the broader implications of international aid programs. With a divided public opinion on the matter, it remains to be seen how this investigation will influence future decisions related to international funding and the balance of supporting foreign initiatives while safeguarding the economic interests of American citizens. 

As the conversation evolves, one thing is clear: the ramifications of the Obama era’s financial decisions still resonate, prompting passionate discussions about the appropriate use of taxpayer dollars in a complex global context.",-13.0,-3.0,621.0,-0.40625,-0.020933977455716585,676.0,-0.14285714285714285,-0.004437869822485207

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

By targeting the Marine Corps, these groups hope to instill a sense of vulnerability within the general public. However, for the Marines, being in the crosshairs is seen as an invitation to directly confront these threats. According to military officials, the billboards serve to underscore their readiness to engage with any adversary, regardless of the ramifications.

This initiative comes on the heels of an uptick in terrorist activities throughout the United States over the past year. The message conveyed through the billboards is stark and clear: the Marines stand ready, and they welcome these threats as opportunities to combat terror head-on. By taking such a bold step, the Marine Corps aims not only to demonstrate their commitment to protecting the nation but also to inspire bravery in the populace.

While the initiative has garnered support among many citizens, it has not been without controversy. Critics, predominantly from liberal circles, have voiced their concerns, with some suggesting that the messaging may prioritize the interests of the Marines over the broader community's safety. Proponents of the campaign, however, argue that the billboards represent a crucial stance against terrorism while promoting public resilience in the face of fear.

The symbolism behind this campaign cannot be underestimated. The billboards convey a powerful message of defiance against the terrorist agenda, characterized by the assertion that intimidation will not prevail. As one Marine stated, ""If the people remain unafraid, terrorists ultimately lose."" This theme resonates deeply, suggesting that the fight against fear is as vital as physical confrontations with adversaries.

Through this bold initiative, the Marine Corps is not only taking a stand for themselves but is also championing a larger message of courage and unity. The hope is that such initiatives will galvanize public sentiment, transforming fear into an unwavering resolve against those who threaten safety and freedom. 

As the nation navigates these challenging times, the Marine Corps continues to underscore their readiness and commitment, making it clear that they will not waver in the face of terror. This campaign is a testament to their pledge to defend the United States against any threat, cultivating a spirit of resilience that fosters cooperation and strength among its citizens.",-53.0,-8.0,449.0,-2.409090909090909,-0.11804008908685969,511.0,-0.4,-0.015655577299412915

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Charlotte, North Carolina, has recently faced chaos and unrest as riots erupted across the city, leading to widespread devastation and a breakdown of public safety. With numerous businesses looted and various crimes surfacing, the situation prompted North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to step in, declaring a state of emergency and activating the National Guard to help restore order.

In the wake of this turmoil, city officials have outlined stringent consequences for individuals caught participating in unlawful acts. Those found guilty of rioting, looting, or engaging in violent behavior will face the permanent revocation of government benefits. This measure is intended to serve as a deterrent against such actions, reinforcing the seriousness with which officials view the unrest.

The implications extend beyond adults, as minor children who are involved in violent incidents could also face repercussions. Officials have stated that these young individuals may lose access to government benefits, while their parents may find themselves at risk of interventions from social services and potential custody loss. This response has raised questions about the role of parental responsibility in curbing youth involvement in criminal activity. City official Wilson Stewart emphasized this aspect, calling upon parents to take active roles in monitoring their children's activities and whereabouts.

Compounding the concern is the fact that many of those detained amidst the riots are high school students. In response to this alarming trend, local authorities have reinforced a mandatory curfew. City officials hope to curb any further escalation of violence while encouraging community members to adhere to these guidelines as part of a collective effort to restore peace in Charlotte.

While these measures have been introduced, the effectiveness of such consequences in preventing future incidents remains uncertain. Nevertheless, officials are sending a clear message that misconduct will not be tolerated, and violators will face serious repercussions.

The blend of frustration, economic impact, and community disruption looms large over Charlotte as residents attempt to navigate through these turbulent times. The establishment of the curfew and the heightened presence of law enforcement, including the National Guard, reflects a commitment to reestablish stability in the city that has been severely affected by the riots.

As Charlotte grapples with the aftermath of these events, the path toward recovery may be long and complex. Community leaders and state officials are aware of the challenge ahead and recognize that rebuilding trust and safety within the city will require a concerted effort from all residents. The responsibility to foster a peaceful environment falls not only on governmental bodies but also on families and community networks to work together in preventing future violence.

As Charlotte emerges from this crisis, the resolutions being proposed highlight the dire need for cooperation and vigilance among all citizens to help heal the fractures caused by recent disturbances. In the face of adversity, the hope is that these collective actions will pave the way for a more peaceful and united future for the city.",-33.0,-32.0,509.0,-1.32,-0.06483300589390963,543.0,-1.5238095238095237,-0.058931860036832415

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

FBI Director James Comey is under increasing pressure following the agency's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal, with critics questioning both his decisions and his commitment to accountability. As political tensions escalate, the fallout from the investigation has led to calls for Comey's resignation and a deeper inquiry into the handling of the case.

One notable point of contention has been Comey's decision to grant immunity to Clinton's top aides, including Cheryl Mills. Critics argue that this move has undermined the integrity of the investigation, especially given allegations that Mills did not fully cooperate with the FBI. In light of these developments, a House Judiciary Committee hearing is scheduled for September 28th, where Comey's future within the agency will be called into further question.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has emerged as a vocal critic of Comey's actions, calling for his resignation and questioning his overall fitness for office. DiGenova has described the investigation as inadequate, arguing that a more robust approach, including the issuance of a grand jury and subpoena for Mills' computer, was necessary to ensure a thorough examination of the details surrounding Clinton's email use.

The scrutiny did not stop at mere criticism. DiGenova has explicitly demanded congressional hearings to delve further into how the case has been managed thus far. There is a growing sentiment among critics that Comey's actions have compromised the FBI’s credibility, particularly in the context of politically charged investigations.

Adding to the tension, Comey has been issued a subpoena by Congress to provide documents related to the investigation. This request follows his previous failure to comply with earlier congressional requests for certain documents, fueling concerns over transparency and accountability. Lawmakers are increasingly anxious to understand whether Comey's handling of the Clinton investigation reflects a broader issue of loyalty to a political figure rather than an unwavering commitment to the principles of justice.

As the situation evolves, questions surrounding Comey's potential bias toward Clinton have become more pronounced. Critics are left pondering whether his decisions were influenced by personal risk or political ramifications, raising alarms about the independence of the FBI and the integrity of its investigations.

In a political landscape fraught with division, the implications of Comey's actions could potentially reshape public trust in federal institutions. The impending House Judiciary Committee hearing on September 28th is set to be a pivotal moment, with the potential to determine not only Comey's future but also the broader responses to the ongoing controversy surrounding the Clinton email situation.

As the investigation continues to unfold, the public and lawmakers alike are poised to demand greater accountability from the FBI, with increasing scrutiny on its leadership and the impact of perceived political affiliations on its operations. Whether Comey can navigate this tumultuous political environment and retain confidence in his leadership will depend on the forthcoming evidence and the outcomes of the scheduled hearings.",-17.0,-11.0,498.0,-0.8947368421052632,-0.03413654618473896,546.0,-0.5789473684210527,-0.020146520146520148

This is monstrous and going on right out in the open. It should be stopped cold… whatever it takes. Britain needs to stop selling the Saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the Saudi bedroom and back home. They are killing us and enslaving women and children.

The depraved thugs are also involved in the radicalisation of young women all over the world and try to tempt them to come to their caliphate with false promises of wealth, marriage and forgiveness of sin.

As the political landscape evolves, questions surrounding the integrity of leadership and the implications of foreign relations have come to the forefront of public dialogue. One of the most pressing concerns is the significant financial influence of foreign nations on U.S. political candidates, particularly regarding the ongoing support for Saudi Arabia. Reports have surfaced highlighting that Saudi Arabia is a major donor to Hillary Clinton's campaign, accounting for approximately 20% of its funding. This substantial contribution raises alarm bells about the potential implications for U.S. foreign policy.

The relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia is increasingly under scrutiny, especially given historical ties to terrorism. Numerous reports have pointed to connections between Saudi nationals and the September 11 attacks, with the Bin Laden family being notably mentioned. Critics argue that this history ought to cast a shadow over continued U.S. support for a regime whose actions contradict fundamental human rights principles.

Further complicating this relationship are allegations of blatant human rights violations within Saudi Arabia itself. Disturbing accusations have emerged stating that the kingdom is engaged in the public auctioning of ISIS sex slaves, drawing participation from a diverse array of nationalities. This alarming practice has highlighted the need for a critical reassessment of U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which continue despite such grave allegations.

The plight of Yazidi women and other victims of trafficking at the hands of ISIS is particularly distressing. Reports detail instances where these women, subjected to horrific abuses, are sold in marketplaces throughout Saudi Arabia. Such revelations underscore a moral obligation to support those who are suffering rather than empower regimes accused of exacerbating such human rights crises.

The article vehemently calls for the cessation of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and urges U.S. political leaders to publicly distance themselves from the kingdom. This position is not merely about foreign policy but encompasses a greater ethical responsibility to halt the slavery and abuse that reportedly persists within Saudi borders. The enmeshment of U.S. political figures with such a regime raises critical ethical questions, particularly regarding the acceptance of substantial donations from a country so deeply implicated in human rights abuses.

Furthermore, claims have surfaced regarding the complicity of both Saudi Arabia and Russia in supporting ISIS. Such alliances, whether directly or indirectly, pose a significant threat not only to regional stability but also to global security. The intertwining of foreign interests and domestic political funding patterns suggests a troubling trend that could further jeopardize human rights.

As the public grapples with these issues, it becomes imperative for voters to critically evaluate political candidates and their connections to foreign funding sources that may be linked to abusive practices. It is essential for citizens to reject candidates perceived as corrupt or indifferent to human rights abuses in favor of those who prioritize ethical governance.

In this climate, the call for change is clear. Advocates for justice and human rights are standing firm, demanding accountability and ethical leadership from those they elect. The challenge lies not only in the political arena but also in the responsibility of the electorate to remain vigilant regarding the relationships that shape their nation’s policies.

In conclusion, the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia warrants serious reconsideration. The implications of foreign funding, historic ties to terrorism, and ongoing human rights abuses present a comprehensive case for reevaluation. As the discourse unfolds, the moral ramifications of accepting support from regimes involved in such violations prompt a call to action for voters and leaders alike—to prioritize human rights and uphold moral integrity in political and international affairs. The future of American foreign policy may well depend on the decisions made today.",-30.0,-21.0,629.0,-1.0,-0.04769475357710652,679.0,-0.75,-0.030927835051546393
Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

The first presidential debate of the election season, held on September 26, was marked by intense exchanges between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump. The night was characterized by contentious discussions as both candidates took to the stage to outline their positions and challenge each other's records.

Moderated by NBC’s Lester Holt, the debate sparked widespread attention not only for the candidates’ back-and-forth but also for Holt's intervention during the discourse. Holt faced criticism, particularly for interrupting Trump to fact-check statements the Republican nominee made, which were deemed inaccurate by some observers. The controversy grew when Holt claimed that Trump had openly supported the Iraq War from its outset, a statement that Trump quickly refuted.

Interestingly, Holt did not press Clinton about her controversial vote to authorize the Iraq War in 2002, a decision that continues to impact her political image. Instead, he focused his inquiries on Trump, bringing up a Fox News interview where Trump expressed reservations about the invasion of Iraq and his uncertainty over the decision. This disparity in questioning has led to frustration among critics who argue that Holt should have challenged Clinton regarding her war authorization, given that she had access to significant intelligence before making her vote.

The media landscape observed during the debate also drew scrutiny. Many commentators expressed that the mainstream media seemed to be attempting to discredit Trump rather than providing a platform for an engaged discussion between the two candidates. This perception raised questions about the role of the moderator and the responsibility of the media to facilitate a fair and balanced exchange of ideas.

Trump, during the debate, was noted for effectively standing up to both Clinton and the media. His assertiveness, coupled with his vigorous challenges to Holt, contributed to a fiery atmosphere throughout the debate. Supporters lauded his performance as a rejection of perceived media bias, while detractors questioned whether his aggressive style overshadowed the fundamental issues at stake in the election.

Overall, the first presidential debate highlighted significant ideological divides between the candidates and set a contentious tone for the remainder of the campaign. Both Clinton and Trump exhibited their strategies to connect with voters, making it clear that the road to the presidency would not be without its challenges. As the election season unfolds, this debate may go down as a pivotal moment that reflects the heightened divisiveness within the American political landscape.",-9.0,-16.0,452.0,-0.5,-0.01991150442477876,456.0,-0.9411764705882353,-0.03508771929824561
Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

The Birther movement, which gained traction during Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, remains a subject of intense debate regarding its racial undertones and the implications for America's political landscape. A critical examination of Obama's origins raises pertinent questions about whether he may have inadvertently contributed to the birth narrative that sparked controversy and speculation.

A pivotal moment in this discourse can be traced back to a 2004 article by the conservative media outlet Breitbart, which referred to Obama as ""Kenyan-born."" The assertion resonated amid the political climate of the time, particularly as Obama prepared for his run for the Illinois Senate seat following the scandal-induced withdrawal of his rival, Jack Ryan. With Ryan's exit, a strategic opportunity emerged for Obama, thrusting him into the spotlight while leaving Republican challengers scrambling for an alternative candidate.

Interestingly, throughout his rise to political prominence, Obama never publicly refuted the claims made in that 2004 article. This silence has led to speculation over the legitimacy of his birthplace and whether the narrative surrounding it was manipulated for personal and political gain.

Adding fuel to the fire, a promotional booklet from Obama's literary agency, dating back to 1991, described him as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” Intended to promote his then-anticipated first book — which ultimately never came to fruition — the booklet has since become a focal point in discussions about Obama's true origins.

The juxtaposition of these claims creates a complex narrative. If Obama’s birthplace in the United States is indeed legitimate, then the assertions in the promotional booklet would logically be false. This contradiction raises accusations of dishonesty against the former president, further complicating the discourse surrounding his identity and eligibility for the presidency.

The implications of this narrative extend beyond mere speculation about Obama’s origins. They invoke broader issues related to race, identity, and authenticity in American politics. As these discussions continue to unfold, analysts question whether the Birther movement's motivations were rooted in racial bias or simply fueled by political opportunism.

Ultimately, the intersection of personal narrative and public perception in Obama's story serves as a reminder of the intricate dance between truth and manipulation in political careers, leaving a legacy of questions about authenticity that lingers in the political conscience of America today.",-18.0,-6.0,447.0,-0.75,-0.040268456375838924,449.0,-0.375,-0.013363028953229399

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights.

In the aftermath of a highly anticipated debate featuring Hillary Clinton, discussions have arisen centered around her performance and the perceived bias of the moderator. The debate quickly became a topic of national interest, with observers dissecting every moment and nuance of Clinton's approach on stage. Many noted the absence of her usual coughing fits, which had been the subject of scrutiny in previous events, further enhancing interest in her presentation.

However, the debate was not without its controversies. One of the most talked-about moments involved speculation surrounding Clinton’s appearance. Social media users pointedly discussed what appeared to be a flesh-colored device in her ear during the event. This speculation sparked widespread debate over whether it was an earpiece intended for receiving assistance or simply a fashion item.

The Clinton campaign was quick to respond to the swirling rumors, firmly denying any presence of an earpiece. A spokesperson attributed the appearance of the device to mere reflections from the studio lights, insisting that there was no external aid involved in her performance. Regardless of the campaign’s dismissal, the notion of an earpiece persisted in public conversations, leaving some unconvinced and leading to further scrutiny.

Adding fuel to the fire, a leaked email from the WikiLeaks archive featured a humorous exchange discussing the potential need for an earpiece. This revelation raised eyebrows and invited additional criticism regarding the transparency of Clinton's campaign strategy, particularly in the context of honesty and reliance on external help during high-pressure situations like debates.

As social media buzzed with commentary, a significant amount of criticism surfaced on platforms such as Twitter. Many users claimed that the presence of an apparent earpiece—whether real or imagined—called into question Clinton’s honesty and integrity. Comments proliferated suggesting that she may require assistance to respond effectively to questions posed during the debate, thus casting shadows on her credentials and qualifications.

The controversy has highlighted a divide in public opinion. While some defend Clinton and argue that the discussion surrounding the alleged device is nothing more than an unfounded conspiracy, others remain skeptical and suggest that the incident raises valid concerns about authenticity. The compelling discourse mirrors the broader political landscape, where perceptions often hold as much weight as verifiable facts.

In the wake of the debate, opinions continue to diverge regarding the implications of the perceived device in Clinton's ear. Was it simply a trick of the light, or is there more to the story? As the Clinton campaign and supporters aim to navigate the fallout, the dialogue surrounding this incident reflects the tensions and complexities of modern political communication. The debate may have concluded, but the questions raised about performance, honesty, and external assistance linger, prompting ongoing discussion among voters and commentators alike.",-5.0,-8.0,521.0,-0.22727272727272727,-0.009596928982725527,521.0,-0.36363636363636365,-0.015355086372360844
